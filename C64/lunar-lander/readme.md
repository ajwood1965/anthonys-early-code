# Lunar Lander
Lunar Lander was an implementation of the popular arcade game. I wrote it in C64 BASIC with a small 6502 machine language subroutine to help with the animations.  This was the first 6502 code I wrote, and I hand assembler since i did not own an assembler (yet) for the 6502.  Ahoy! [purchased Lunar Lander for $400 in 1984](../../scans/1984-6-15-ahoy-composite.jpg), and it made the cover of the April 1984 edition.

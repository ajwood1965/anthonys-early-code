# Banner
This program would print signs on a lineprinter.  The user would enter their message (like "Happy Birthday"), and the software looked up each letter's bit pattern in the character ROM and then rotated and expanded each character to print the sign (each letter was the hight of a page, and line printers used pages that were connected to each other so that the banner might be, say 11" x 80", for example).   I submitted the program to Ahoy! magazine, but it was rejected.

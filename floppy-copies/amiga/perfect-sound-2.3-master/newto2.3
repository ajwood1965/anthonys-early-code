You have received PSOUND 2.3. Be sure to send in your registration
in order to hear about new versions.

Differences between 2.3 and 2.2:

1. Fixed bug that caused Perfect Sound not to work with Byte by Byte
   PAL systems.

2. Fixed "Bug code 2" error that occured with some mouses

3. Added menu option to turn off the Amiga 500/2000 low pass filter.
   This filter is located on the audio output of all Amigas. It causes
   sounds above 3KH to be cut off.  On the 500 or 2000, this filter
   can be turned off.  The result is much higher frequency response.
   However, this can also introduce "aliasing" noise.

Differences between 2.2 and 2.1:

1. New record routines to allow support of 500/2000 PSound.
2. Fixed bug that caused small differences in playback and
   record speeds (It's really fixed this time, I promise).
3. Now uses standard Intuition AutoRequesters.


Differences between version 2.1 and 2.0:

1. Memory allocation problems have been fixed. Deleting no
   longer crashes and running Perfect Sound doesn't lose memory.
2. New stop and graph gadgets.
3. Now uses Microsmiths/Aegis file requester.
4. Graph is about 5 times faster.
5. New "Zero Range" option.
6. Project menu with "new" "open" and "quit".
7. Playback speed now exactly matches record speed.
8. Many other minor bug fixes and improvments.

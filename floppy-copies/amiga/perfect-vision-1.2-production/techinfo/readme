HOW TO ACCESS PERFECT VISION USING YOUR OWN SOFTWARE


Perfect Vision uses the folowing sequence to grab pictures:


1. PV grabs an interlaced picture and stores in its own 64K of DRAM
2. Amiga Reads 128000 nybbles (4 bits) of data
3. goto 1


You must always read 128000 bytes (only lower 4 bits used) even
if you don't want an interlaced picture.  Also, the DRAMS will decay if
you don't read the data fast enough. They are not refreshed by PV.


example to read two frames:


read()
{
static char buf1[128000],buf2[128000];

grab_frame(buf1);
grab_frame(buf1+64000);

grab_frame(buf2);
grab_frame(buf2+64000);
}

Note: you can use pack_grab() to save memory. It grabs and stores two
pixels per byte on the fly.

Note: the routines pack_grab() and grab_frame() are designed to
assemble with the Lattice Assembler supplied with LC 4.0.

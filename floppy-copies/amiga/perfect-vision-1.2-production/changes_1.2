This file outlines the changes between Perfect Vision 1.1 and 1.2.

Color Splitter Support
----------------------


In the "Build Buffers" options, there are two new commands:

>RED

Clicking on this toggles between >GRN, >BLU, >RED.  If you have
the Auto cable connected between the Color Splitter and the Perfect Vision,
this changes the current color.  The effect is the same as flipping the
RGB switch on the front of the color splitter.  Remember that you still
have to grab the color frame after you select this option.  This option
only changes which color component of the video signal is being delivered
to the Perfect Vision.

AUTO

Clicking on this menu will cause the red, green, and blue buffers to
automatically be filled if you have your Color Splitter connected to your
Perfect Vision with the Auto cable.


New Cycle Option
----------------


Histogram

Clicking this option when in cycle will cause a dynamic histogram to be
updated each time a picture is grabbed and displayed.  The histogram shows
the amount of each gray scale present in the picture.  The histogram
is helpful in setting the brightess and contrast knobs.  You can see
the histogram shift and change as these controls are adjusted.


New Pallete Options in the 32 Color Menu
----------------------------------------

When you are in the 32 color menu, clicking on "Palette" now brings
a new menu with three options:

Edit Palette

This option allows you to change the colors used to create 32 color
pictures.

Num Colors

This allows you to change the number of colors used when creating a 32 color
picture.  For example, you can create pictures that consist of only 8 or 16
colors.  However, the less colors you use, the worse the quality of the
picture will be.

Num Lock

This lets you enter the number of colors to lock.  This locks into the
palette colors starting at zero and going up to the ammount you specify.
Previous versions of Perfect Vision would let you lock the entire palette;
now you can lock any amount of colors in the palette.

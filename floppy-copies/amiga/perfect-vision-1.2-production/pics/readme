                  Industries employee trying to sell a koozie.

                  the above typical employee in 3d. To view picture, hold
                  the blue filter over your right eye and the red over
                  your left eye. The picture was done by taking two
                  pictures (a red and blue, but WITHOUT the filters) and
                  shifting the camera between each shot (No green picture
                  was taken.)

Dear Customer,

This disk is the latest version of the Perfect Vision software.  As
the proverbial ink is still wet on this version, we still are not sure
it is completely bug-free.

Since this is the case, we are sending 25 copies of this version (of
which your's is one) to our first color splitter owners.  We would
appreciate any written or telephoned feedback you can give us on how
this software works for you.

Thank you,

Thom Robertson
Chief Technician

               STUDIO MAGIC ERRATA FOR VERSION 1.1


Copy Protection

We have removed the copy protection from Studio Magic that was
present in version 1.0. Feal free to make as many backups as you
wish.  However, please do not pirate.


FEATURES LEFT OUT OF THE MANUAL


Delays

This introduces a digital delay into the selected range.  The
delays simulate the acoustics of a large room.  Fewer delays
and longer intervals will produce an echo-like effect.  More
delays and shorter intervals inject a richness into the sample.


Flange

This is the source of those screaming, spitting guitars "heavy
metal" bands use.  Two samples are created, one being slightly
faster than the other.  Then the slower sample is started,
followed by the faster one.  The buzzing feedback is created as
the faster sample catches and passes the slower.  This is a very
versatile tool.


Invert

This takes each byte of the range bounded by the two sliders and
flips it. 2 becomes -2, -120 becomes 120, and so on.  A sample
overlaid on its inverse becomes all zeros.  Try overlaying the
inverted sample after using other tools on it.


Set MIDI Channel

This sets the channel from which Studio Magic receives MIDI
information.  The default is 1.  This is important in a MIDI
set-up with several connected machines.


Tempo Adjust

This adjusts the tempo of the MIDI sequencing options.  It does
not change the sequence itself, just the rate of the internal
MIDI clock.

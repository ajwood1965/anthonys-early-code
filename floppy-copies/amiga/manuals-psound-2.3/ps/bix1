That completes your registration.  Further use of BIX
will indicate your acceptance of the above terms.  If you
agree, answer 'Yes' to the next two questions and then
wait until the main BIX prompt -- a colon ( : ) -- is
displayed by itself at the start of a line.  At that
point, typing a carriage return will automatically join
you to a short tutorial on how to use BIX.  If you stay
on BIX until the ' : ' prompt, the sign-up fee and
subsequent use of BIX will be billed to your credit
card.

Do you still want to register? (y/n): y
Are you sure? (y/n): y

That completes your registration.

Welcome to BIX.  Typing a carriage return will take you to the
"learn" conference
 to help you get familiar with the system.
This conference is free for your first two weeks on BIX!  Feel
free to explore it at your leisure without worrying about connect
time charges.

We will mail you your user manual and subscriber agreement
within the next few days.  Please complete, sign and return
your subscriber agreement immediately to avoid any interruption

--------------------------
Welcome to the BYTE Information Exchange!  As a new user, you are
automatically registered in this conference, a short orientation and
a hands-on demonstration of BIX's features.   This message covers
basic commands and the help system; the next message is a thumbnail
sketch of BIX.  You can read these two messages and go explore BIX
on your own, or you can continue with the tutorial for more detailed
explanations. 

If you would like to download this tutorial for future reference,  type 
"join learn/down" and follow the instructions you will find there.

[NOTE:  whenever you see the .More.. prompt hit <RETURN> for the next
 screen.]


ABOUT BIX
BIX offers you two ways to communicate with other BIX users:  publicly, 
.More..
in CONFERENCES and privately, using MAIL.   You will want to read the
list of available conferences, join those that interest you, read some or
all of the messages already in the conferences and respond to them, and
add your own to the discussion.  In the mail subsystem, you can read 
messages addressed to you, and you can compose, edit, and send messages
to other BIX users.

A few basic commands are useful throughout the system and will help
you find your way out of any confusion you may encounter.  THE KEY YOU
WILL USE MOST OFTEN IS <RETURN>  (carriage return, Enter, or <CR>, 
which will take you from one message to another when you are reading
through a conference, from one mail message to the next, and so forth.
Use <RETURN> after you type a command or when you see a prompt like
Read: or .More...  At most prompts, you can type "?" and BIX will describe
the most useful commands available to you at that point. 

WHEN IN DOUBT, TRY EITHER A CARRIAGE RETURN OR A QUESTION MARK, 
AND BIX WILL PROBABLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.

When you make a mistake or type a command that BIX does not recognize,
.More..
you will usually get a list of your options along with the error message.

"Quit" is another extremely useful command.   Anytime you want to 
LEAVE WHAT YOU ARE DOING, whether it be reading a long message, 
reading through a conference, or reading your mail, "quit" or "q" will
do the job.

The abort command, to interrupt what you are doing and return to a 
prompt is <Control> K.

IF YOU WANT TO END YOUR SESSION WITH BIX the command is "bye".  
This logs you off the system immediately, without asking for 
confirmation, so use it only if you mean it. 

HOW TO GET HELP
There are several sources of help here.  The on-line manual is a conference
called user.manual.  Type "join user.manual/table" for a table of contents.

To use the help files:
* Type "help [command]" for general help on that command.
.More..
* At most prompts, "help" or "?" will display a list of your options.
* Typing "[command] ?" will list valid arguments or subcommands 
  to [command].
* For a list of the commands for which help is available, type 
  "help hfiles".  For a listing of BIX commands and subcommands, 
  type "help commands".  

HELPER:  If you have a question that is not answered in user.manual, the
learn conference, or the help files, you can drop a mail note to "helper".
A BIX troubleshooter will answer your question.

IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE LOGGING ON under your own name and password, 
log on with the BIX ID "tohelper", and password "help".  You can then leave
a message describing your problem.  Be sure to include your phone number
so that we can get back to you.  

IF YOU NEED TO TALK TO A HUMAN, you can call the BIX offices at 
1-800-227-BYTE.  Office hours are 8:30 AM to 11:00 PM Eastern time.

HOW TO USE THIS TUTORIAL
.More..
Throughout this tutorial, commands that you can type are listed in 
"quotation marks" and arguments or options to commands are in 
[square brackets].  NEVER TYPE THE QUOTATION MARKS OR SQUARE 
BRACKETS.   Fill in the appropriate numbers or words for what you see 
within the brackets.  Most BIX commands can be abbreviated.  In this
tutorial, commands are spelled out in full, but you need only type enough
letters of a command to distinguish it from others.  In general, two or 
three letters will do. 

In reading through this tutorial conference, if you want to reread the 
previous message, type "skip back 1" at the Read: prompt.  To go back 
to the top of the message you are presently reading, type "skip back 0".

               conference you will be prompted to register.  If you are
               already a member, you will go directly to that conference.
* <RETURN>     In the conferencing subsystem, you can read through all
               new messages in all your conferences simply by hitting 
               <RETURN>.  This will take you from one message to the next, 
               from one topic to the next, and from one conference to the 
               next.
* skip         If you don't want to read the conference from the beginning, 
.More..

* say/comment  Add your own messages to a conference using either
               "say" (for an original statement) or "comment" (to remark on
               a message already there).  End your message with a period as
               the only character on a line.  
* add          To add your message to the conference, type "add" at the 
               add/action: prompt.  You can "edit" or "clear" the message
                instead, if you prefer.
* resign       To remove a conference from your list, so that you do not 
               see new messages posted there, type "resign [conference name]".
              
MAIL
* Mail         To leave the conferencing subsystem and enter Mail, 
               simply type "mail" at the Read: prompt.  You will see a 
               list of your incoming and outgoing mail. 
* <RETURN>     To read the first message in your In-Basket, simply
               hit <RETURN>.  Read any other message by typing its number.
.More..

               If you want to keep the message, type "leave".
* to [BIXname]  To send a mail message, use the "to" command.  To find
               someone's BIX ID, type "show who [and whatever part of the 
               person's real or BIX name you happen to know]".  End the message
               with a period as the only character on a line. 
* send         To send the message, type "send" at the send/action: prompt.
               If you wish to edit it, type "edit" at the prompt, instead of 
               "send".   If you have changed your mind about sending the
               message,  type "clear" instead of "send".  

THE EDITOR
* edit         When you type "edit" at the add/action: prompt in a conference,
               or at the send/action: prompt in mail, you enter BIX's default
               editor, the verbose editor.   Since BIX uses packet-switching
               communication, the editor must be line-oriented rather than 
               a full-page editor.  Editor commands are SINGLE LETTER 
               COMMANDS.  
* l            LIST:  To see your message, with line numbers, type "l".
.More..
* a            APPEND:  Add text at the end of the message.
* a[#]         INSERT: Use append with a line number to insert text after 
               the line specified.
* s[#]         SUBSTITUTE:  Make a substitution on the line specified.
* w            WRITE:  Save current text.
* q            QUIT:  Abandon current copy of text, return to earlier copy.
* c            CLEAR:  Discard text and exit editor.
* x            EXIT:  Save edited text and exit editor. 


OPTIONS
You can adapt your BIX environment to your own tastes and needs.  
You can see message headers and prompts in their short forms, you 
can set your screen's page length and width, you can change what you
see automatically on logging in, and you can change your default editor
to the quiet editor.  See the user.manual conference, topics "options"
and "profile" for details. 


SUGGESTIONS, COMPLAINTS, AND QUESTIONS
.More..
Send mail to "suggestions", "complaints" or "helper".


This should be enough information to get you started.  If you would like
more detailed explanations, continue with this tutorial.  If you prefer
to explore on your own, type "resign learn".  If you want to come back 
to the tutorial later, simply "join learn".   If you set your page length
to 0 to capture this message, remember to reset it, using 
"opt term page 20 q".  You can substitute any number for the "20" if you
want to see fewer lines (or more) between .More.. prompts.

I hope, if no other method appears, to have my procedure "blessed" by
someone (Dale??) so we can use it without worry.  In the mean time, the
method works with 1.2 and has run on the new machines with 1.2 in ROM
so I suspect it is ok for a while at least.  There appears to be no other
way around the problem so I may just have to risk future incompatibility.

I'n not sure if it was titlecraft, but one of those type programs we had a
sample of here wouldn't even run if you had an expansion drive plugged in.
Usually these kind of problems get fixed real quick once the programmer
realizes his ins't the only possible amiga configuration.

A conference would also allow questions to be answered once rather than
hundreds of times while doing Beta testing of products. (It also helps
keep early development dirty linen a bit away from tender public eyes

I assume you have tried altering the values in both the in memory preferences
structure AND intuitionbase at the same time. If not note that there are
duplicate values for all these constants sprinkled throughtout the various
Amiga structures. Hitting them ALl may be what is needed.

TITLE: A2000 & A500 launch in London.
I attended the London launch of these two micro's... things
went well.  Lovely lunch, with some good speeches by
Chris Kaday (head of CBM UK) and Fred Harris (TV personality)..
 
UKpricing is   A500 = 499 pounds, and A2000 = 1095 pounds.
 
At the current $ to Pound exchange rate that is... :
 
A500 = $750, and A2000 = $1642.50
 
These prices are a trifle on the high side (especially the A500, which really
oughta be 399 pounds, not 499!) but they are acceptible.

TITLE: Arrgghh!
 
Someone at C-A.   Help!!??  
 
I was assured that the A2000 and A500 was totally and utterly
compatible with the A1000.
 
Many months ago, when I asked CBM if I could borrow a machine, or at least
to SEE one so that I could test out my game on it before I launched, they
said it won't be necessary cos the machine is identical in every way!
 
Today, at the launch.. I booted up my StarGlider on a A2000
and BOOM, it crashes after the first keypress!
 
The same disk, booted up perfectly on an A500, and on an A1000,
and even on an A1000 with extra memory (byte by byte PAL box)... so
.More..
why should it not work on an A2000!???
 
I expected something like this to happen.   What I'm upset about
is that Commodore were more interested in showing the Press and Corporates
these machines, when what would have been more helpful is letting Developers
have documentation, and early machines to ensure their software
worked perfectly on it.
 
Chris Kaday has very ki8ndly supplied me an A2000 on loan, so that I can
sort out this problem before we launch...   When I've discovered what the
problem was, I shall put a fix up here on BIX, with a warning to other
developers.  BUT THIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOLD HAVE BEEN
WARNED ABOTUT earlier!!

A few possibilities, none of them real problems:
(1) Does the program have any trouble with extra memory?  Recall that the
A2000 always has a meg of memory.
(2) The second 1/2 meg on the A2000, or the A500 with the RAM/Clock card
is located at $C00000.  We ran into one library that for some unknown
reason was doing 24bit arithmetic on addresses.  When it sign-extended
pointers in the fast RAM, is screwed up.  Same thing would happen on an
A1000 with memory above the halfway mark.  Try your program on an A500
with the RAM/Clock card to eliminate or confirm this guess.
(3) The A2000 might have had a beta 1.2 in.  Some of the A2000s might
still be using the EPROM tower with 4 512K EPROMs on it.  If so, there's
a chance that the code in it is not the release of 1.2.  All A500s have
the 2 meg ROM with the release 1.2 code; this is also the ROM that
SHOULD be in all A2000s.

My Amiga I use in the office has a Byte by Byte PAL, which also has memory in th
e
$c0000 range...  and it works perfectly there, so why
not on an A2000!?
 
Also, my entire program is loaded into CHIP memory, anyway!
 
Also, the game is O S independant, and makes no use of the OS at all.
It drives the hardware directly, with its own interupt servers etc etc.

 
Has the Keyboard Interupts, or hardware changed at all on the A2000!?

Some of the prototype 512K cards were ``less than 100% reliable''.  I
wouldn't be surprised if all the good ones ended up at Hannover.

Honest, there are not supposed to be any hardware incompatibilities
with the A1000.  The A2500 *is* an A1000 on the same board as a "zorro"
backplane.

We did have a problem with some demo's here.  It turned out that an old
release of the lattice libraries did something goofy when working with
addresses above "7FFFFF" (the 512K sits at C00000).  The problems went
away when the demo's were recompiled/relinked with the current version.

The keyboard related hardware in the box is identical.  The keyboard
contains a (gag, puke) Intel chip that is supposed to be emulating
the (sigh) MOS 6500/1 chip in the Amiga keyboard.  The initial production
also has real n-key rollover, which may get "cost reduced".

The identical 1.2 ROM's work on all machines, so this seems tranparent.

What are the symptoms, doctor?

TITLE: Developer's Discounts & Limits
In the letter about the certified developers discounts, it said there was
a limit of three systems / developer. Is that only on A1000? If I get a
A1000 now under the program... will I still be able to get say, two
A2000's and an A500 (when available)? [Total of 4 systems...]
(I'd like to retire my rather old A1000 to do accounting/tax/etc... and
get a brand spanking new one for development...plus A2000 and A500... to
have all systems on market)

Symptoms are, ...
 
The game starts as normal...  It patches in all its Interupt vectors
and then pops up a question to type in a password from the manual
(the dreaded piracy protection, but not copy protection)
 
After typing the first character, (which it receives and prints
onscreen perfectly) it crashes.  Freezes up.
 
I can only assume that the Handshaking on the keyboard has been
changed...!??

Well, since it's different keyboard processor code/chip, the time constraints
might not be exactly the same...

When you say crashes, do you mean the keyboard stops working, or are there
more global symptoms?  Do you get any periodic scummy characters, or just
silence.

If it's just the keyboard locking up, then perhaps you are being precipitous
with your acknowledgement - can you try to (as a test) slow that down?

Yup.. that was the problem!!
 
I added a delay to the Keyboard Handshake routine, and it now works
perfectly!!!
 
Okay folks... be warned.  The timings on the new Amiga A2000's keyboard
processor require a different (much longer) handshake period than the
normal A1000's or A500's keyboard processor requires!
 
I had to put in a delay of... :
 
        moveq   #63,d0
keyloop dbra    d0,keyloop1
.More..
 
.. to get it to work.. whereas the Amiga A1000 doesn't require any delay at all
apart from the time taken up by the actual keyboard driver code itself.

The loop delay solution works on the 68000 but will it do so on
a 14meg 68020? Keep your mind open to the idea that the A2000 has empty
slots that many people want to fill with fast 68020 boards.
Also, developing software that does not use the input device has to
be done carefully if you want it to support alternate keyboards around
the world. Don't forget that at least half the Amiga sales are happening
outside north America. That is why SETMAP and keymaps were added to 1.2!

You mean you're not using ANY of the OS -- No references to ExecBase,
GfxBase, etc.  IE you run just fine under 1.1, 1.0, etc. (providing it
can handle the hunktypes you use...).  And of course, just loading
into ChipMem wouldn't imply that's all you use, in the general case.
But you're using all your own allocation, etc., so that can't be the 
trouble.  The keyboard processor on the A2000 is running a slightly
differnet program (prevents key "ghosting", I'm not sure of the exact
details), but the hardware used is exactly the same, still the 8520
synchronous serial port.  All the chips are located in the same memory
locations as what you get with an A500 and its clock board.  The
system has the ability to mix additional interrupts from the expansion
bus in with those currently used in the system, but nothing I know of
has ever used any of these extra interrupts; all peripherals I've seen
to date still use /INT2 or /INT6 as on an A1000 or A500.  I'll give this
some more thought, but offhand I can't think of anything about an A2000
.More..
that software could choke on or even detect as different over an A1000
or A500.  I'll help you on this anyway I can.

Yup.. no references AT ALL, to ExecBase, GFXBase etc etc...
 
Its great to be OS independant.  It means total freedom.
 
No matter what OS the user has, be it 1.0, V27, 1.1, 1.2 etc... 
as long as it can load in a Chip-Mem AmigaDos file, it will run it!
 
First thing the code does is install all its own Interupt vectors, for
things like VBlanks, Keyboard, Timer chips, Audio chips, Copper, Blitter
etc etc... And from then on, StarGlider 'owns' the machine, and nothing
suspect gets in the way.  There are no long input chains, or tasks
that eat up the performance of the machine.   Its great to run as fast
as the machine allows, rather than at the speed of the multi tasking

system.
 
Alas, the problem with this, is that when CBM hardware is changed (like on the A
2000
keyboard processor) then I have a problem if it wasn't 100% compatible 
hardware.   Luckily, GRR guessed right, and it was indeed the
handshaking times being more fussy on the A2000 than on the A1000.  A
short delay solved the problem.   But why was it changed in the
first place!???
 
It works perfectly now (thank god, cos we launch next week!)

I thing the Germans just went to their favorite PC keyboard vendor and said
"make us one that works like this".  The vendor used their favorite micro-
controller and programmed it to work like the description in the hardware
manual.  Since the keyboard handlers apparently do something useful before
doing the acknowledge, no problem was observed.

This is one of the problems with deciding to deal with the raw hardware.  We
will only promise some arbitrary level of compatibility between different
machines or revisions, with the test criteria being whether our software and
most of the popular packages still work correctly.

As in this case, some micro-features or obscure internal details will get 
changed and we won't notice or don't think it matters.  Also when we add new
features, such has a 2MB chip memory chipset, we will try to make the changes
.More..
in such a way that they are transparent to *our* software.  You may or may not
guess right.

So, intelligent use of some of the Exec/Graphics libraries except for the
spots where you need all out performance would tend to insulate you from
most of the changes.  I am sympathetic to your desire to get every ounce
of performance out of the machine, however the tradeoff may be that you
have to release a new version every time we come out with a new or improved
machine...

I have to agree with you Jez.  I just go stinking stark-raving mad when
somone tries to inflict a complex virtual-meta software layer between me
and the hardware (like GEM maybe) claiming portability, upward expandability,
and sometimes even "simplicity".  Fact is every-time they relink the
software there's a good chance some compatability problem (which you can
be sure they'll say is my fault) will arise.  Changing of hardware
addresses requires more deliberate effort at least!  In fact most hardware
people I know these days avoid changing the bits of the hardware the
software depends on because then they'll have to re-write the system software,
and they KNOW what a pain that will be.   

And of course when a higher-resolution deeper color machine comes along that
really does force the hardware to change, I'm sure you like I will prefer just
to rewrite your application to take advantage of it.

I assume as new machines come out, that the discount limit will change.  I
think the point was not to keep you from getting one of each, but rather to
establish that it's not an unlimited discount for a "developer" and all his
Amiga desiring friends.  It also allows Commodore to budget the maximum amount
that the discount program will "cost".

The A2000's have already started to appear a some of the key hardware

 You're right of course, I just wish there was a "low-level" entry point
 to the whole Amiga - just a monitor and SIMPLE dos - strictly single
 user.  I'm convinced that if the continual time-overhead and general
 complexity of the amiga's O/S wasn't imposed on developers, there'd be
 lots more software available NOW.
 By the way, a standard A1000 seems to like a keyboard handshake delay
 of 75 microsceconds ..er microseconds - I never got away with no delay
 at all.
 As soon as CBM come up with 2MB chip-memory - I'll bet that "go-it-alone"
 guys have their software converted first.

Geez, Jim, how can you compare GEM/AES/VDI with the Amiga system software?
At least the Amiga software makes an effort to have a standard interface.
It was difficult to deal with the multiple changes early on, or to cope
with the fixes in V1.2 that changed how some functions work; but I think
there's a pretty good chance most Amiga software that uses the software
interface will work with improved hardware, or with perhaps a substitute
DOS that has a compatability mode.

The Funkeys program (with Charlie's FastFonts package) has a great feature
for programs that have window-sizing gadgets... hit one key and the active
window expands to the full screen. So far, except for Metascope, all
programs I have tried will let their windows go full-screen (I've got
672x448 interlaced more-rowed workbench screen...). I fully expect them to
open up to 1024x1024 when that is available! :-)

TITLE: GetMsg questions
In Carolyn's conspacket program and Phillp's asendpkt programs they
both use packets that are sent to dos devices. What is confusing 
is how the results get returned. Essentially it boils down to this :
When I use PutMsg() and the WaitPort() and then GetMsg() the pointer
returned from GetMsg is *not* the same as the packet I allocated.
So I assume the exec is making up it's own message to send to me.
Secondly, conspacket doesn't even try to get the return value of
GetMsg() it just assumes that the contents of *packet are changed,
why? As an experiment try this :
        rp = CreatePort(NULL,NULL);
        pid = DeviceProc("DF0");
        packet = (struct StandardPacket *) AllocMem(etc)
        ... intialize packet to do somethine harmless ...
        PutMsg(pid,packet);
        WaitPort(rp);
.More..
 foo = GetMsg(rp);
        printf("pointer 1 %lx, pointer 2 %lx\n",(long)packet,(long)foo);
        /* They are different on my machine */
        FreeMem(packet,etc); 
Note that the result is in foo->res1 and not packet->res1. Am I misunderstanding
something or is it Carolyn and Phillip?

On the other hand, if I'd bought a software product for use on one machine,
and then upgraded to another which was supposed to be software compatible, I
would be most unhappy to find that that product failed on the new machine
because the author chose to bypass that "complex virtual-meta software layer". 
Have a look at the history of software on the IBM PC and the many programs
which failed on newer models and configurations because the author refused to
"play by the rules".

Even if you adopt a policy of free-upgrades in such cases (highly unusual in
the case of games) you have still caused the user inconvenience.  I don't find
such a practice all that friendly or desirable.

No matter how powerful systems become, there is always someone who wants to
push them to their limits (I'm sure there are people out there complaining that
their Cray just won't let them write fast enough code).  I understand the

desire, but like most desires, if untempered by reason and wisdom it can lead
to trouble.

--------------------------
In many respects, I agree with both of you.  The OS software is designed
to make everything hardware independent, and if everyone's clever enough
about their coding, and doesn't go under the OS at all, AND the designers
of future OSs don't monkey around with any black-box aspects of the
system routines, the code should be running on the A4000 or whatever in
a giant multi-megapixel screen in 10 years or so.  
On the other hand, we've got no business changing any hardware unless that
change buys you something.  I believe that the few electical changes in the
100 pin bus will buy more sophistication in possible expansion cards.  And
the change to the A2000 form factor will buy you a much lower cost main
box.  A slower keyboard doesn't do anyone any good, other than perhaps
making the job a very small bit easier for the folks who came up with it.
Hardware CAN change at any time, but I think we're morally obligated to
either keep it the same or improve it.  For the moment, at least, I'm
treating this keyboard thing, at least from my viewpoint as A2000 guy in
West Chester, as a reported bug that should be investigated and if at
.More..
all possible fixed.

Well, there were a number of packages that did, really, break rules.  Like
a few that don't request CHIP_MEM for gadgets and floppy buffers, or the
more insidious things like Transformer that hard code the location of
the ROM Kernal routines they use instead of opening libraries like any
civilized program.  Other than that, I'm not sure what breaks under 1.2

GetMsg() should be returning a pointer to an exec message structure. It
should be the same one you sent. The exec message and packet are
not normally together...the standard packet structure is for
convenience.

In an environment where the full memory space of the Amiga is used the
"take over the machine" programs are destructive. That is to say they are
worse than useless. It takes too bloody long to refill 9.5 megabytes of
memory with the data you loose forcing that reboot. If I had to do that for
every package I ran, say switching from MaxiPlan to Scribble! to Diga! to
A-talk to Lattice C to Aztec-C to Assembler to ... well you get the idea
I sincerely hope. Take over the machine is fun for kiddie games; but, this
is almost TOO much machine to devote to that once it is expanded. Packages
that force me to reboot begin to find their way to the dusty part of the
bookcases. They are dragged out to show off the Amiga after it has been
turned off for awhile - say for transport. (And I wish I had even more
memory to leave things resident in than the 2.5 megs I am living in now.
It is nice; but, more would be nicer. And to think when the PC came out
the original machine was 64k with 640k potential address space. "64K is all
that most people will need and NOBODY will ever need more than 640K." Seems

I didn't directly compare GEM with the Graphics/Layers library.  I mean
I even use the Amiga functions, and the ST ones went out the window about
one week into program development.  When I get a 68020 in an Amiga so that
the IO's not CPU bound I may even stop griping about AmigaDOS!  Still with
no memory protection I'm going to have to figure out how to squirt a program
in through the parallel port from Amiga to Amiga like EA does from PC to
Amiga.  Has anyone already done this?

But my main point is that depending on the intermediate software to be
stable is generally more risky than depending on the hardware to be
stable.  With luck this will change someday, and someday we'll have
screen-io that's just as fast and portable as getc() in the C function
library.  That day hasn't come yet though.  If I have to write specific
screen drivers for each new machine, they might as well be fast, no?

The "Read" command from the early developers kit should do it.  As
best I remember, the format was pretty simple - just hex ascii, which
you can send direct to the parallel port on the transmitter.  That's
assuming Read still works under V1.2. (^.^)

--------------------------
Well, I would certainly agree with you that system software isn't as stable as
it should be.  It is part of a much larger problem - software isn't as stable
as it should be.  Everytime someone has to change a piece of critical code,
everyone winces because they know that it probably means more headaches.  But,
if you write software which depends upon a specific hardware configuration,
your software becomes a prime candidate for being one of those whose stability
is questionable.  I say that because I don't necessarily agree with your
assertion that the hardware is more stable than the intermediate software.  For
instance, the system software on the A2000 is now in ROM (which I still feel a
bit sad about) and as a result, will likely remain unchanged for years (not at
all unusual).  The machine hardware, on the other hand, might undergo many
transformations: one type of memory chip becomes much cheaper than another type
so the design is modified; a different model of a controller chip comes out
which offers some advantages; etc.  These changes would only be made, of
course, if the designers felt that the new version were compatible with the
.More..
old.  As in the change in the keyboard controller on the A2000, the standard
for determining that the changes were compatible is likely to be that the new
configuration works with the system software.  That may not be a thorough
enough analysis of the compatibility but, it is the way it is often done.  If
your software only accessed the hardware via the system software, there would
only be a few types of changes they could make to the hardware which could
affect it.  If you handle it yourself, you may turn up an incompatibility no
one else had anticipated ... and you might find little sympathy along the way
since it was your choice to avoid the rules the designers laid down which
ultimately led to the problem.

And I'm only speaking, here, of the metamorphoses a hardware design might
undergo during its production lifetime for the purpose of saving money,
increasing reliability, etc. - I'm not even dealing with the case of
an upgraded machine which promises compatibility but which has had radical
design changes.

Ultimately, I don't know what real position to take on all of this.  If you are
writing software which pushes the machine to its limits, you will probably need
to bypass the system software.  I'd like to just say, "Don't do it", but I know
.More..
that there will always be a market for such software and I'd be hardpressed to
insist that you should avoid that market for reasons of purism.  I guess I
would only suggest that, if you are going to be addressing such a market, have
some pity on your customers and make extraordinary efforts to see to it that
such a decision doesn't quickly become "their problem."

Just because the A2000 and A500 have their 1.2 OS in Rom does
not necessarily mean that it will remain unchanged for very long!
 
Due to lack of space, there were some things that didn't make it into 1.2
that I'll bet CBM would really like to be in there!

TITLE: Console Device
First of all, Thanks to whoever posted the Console Device code
in the programs section. It sure makes the clipboard alot easier.

Second, I do have a question about the code however. I was wondering
when (if?) I had to call the CBPost routine. Do I call it before I close
the device, or after I cut something to the clipboard or what? I really
wish there was some more documention on the Clipboard, because I feel
that it is a very important feature of a multitasking machine.
(Or is there documentation I have yet to find.. The most I have found
has been in RKM Vol. 2, and even that is very, very sketchy...)

Thanks.

Well, the point he made about the arbiter of compatibility being "does it 
work with current software?" with that "current software" being the system
software is valid. I have been told the "frlom" problem has been fixed on 
newer A1000 keyboards. This may have caused a subtle alteration in timeing.
As it turns out not enough to affect you. Other hardware changes have involved
the disk drives. I have heard (unsubstantiated by me) claims that some CP'd
packages will not run on some of the drives were installed in different
runs of Amigas. Your pushing the machine to the ultimate will fall in
that region. More specifically to you is the three special chips for
the Amiga. Original deliveries had a rev 5 on one of them. Current rev is 8
on latest manufactured machines (that I know of). (Century Computing out here
has the rev 8 Daphne or Denise or whatever it is this week for ca $50.) It
offers some subtle fixes that make Genlock work better than on rev 7 chips which
fixed something else while unfixing the tiny Genlock problem. If such can
affect Genlock, however subtly, a program which pushes timing limits and
.More..
machine parameters is not guaranteed to work on all revs of the machines.
the fact that it runs on your A1000's, the A500 you tested, and now the
A2000 you tested is a very good sign. You seem to be aware of this issue and
are doing proper tests. I just hope you're ready to be burned by one or
more combinations out there...

I wouldn't be surprised if some of the CP schemes do fail on different drives.
Schemes involving various slimy tricks like writing at a non-standard speed,
non-standard bit timing and wimpy bits are often fail because brand-x drives
either do better or worse then brand-y drives.  Of course they are also known
to fail on the same drive, after time or depending on the phase of the moon.^[k.

Also, most of the latest chip revisions have been aimed at improving yield,
rather than functional changes.  Thus. assuming that the chip testing at MOS
was catching all the problems, good chips of various revisions are supposed
to be interchangable.

Hello Charlie,

You digitizer is on its way... I hope you like it. Thanks for the stuff
you sent.  I'm curious about fast fonts... what method did you use to
speed it up?  With our desktop publishing program, we got some speed
up by reading directly from the fonts bitmap and writing to our destination
bitmap.  Wy bypass the blitter and all Text calls. This speeds things
up because we actualy resize the text when we move it.  The size
depends on your display magnification, and is never just like a
call to TEXT would put it.          

Keep in touch, 
Anthony

TITLE: amiga.dev/digest
Welcome to the amiga.dev "digest" topic. Here we will give you a weekly  
(or bi-weekly [depending on activity]) overview of all the following topics.
The "digest" is a valuable tool in saving you time from reading the hundreds
of messages that might appear in a small period of time.

TITLE: First Digest for Amiga.dev

   The next message is the first Amiga.dev digest.  It summarizes all
amiga.dev postings through Sunday Feb 15, 1987.  We'll probably be doing 
these digests twice a month.  The next one will cover the rest of Feb.
I'd like to thank Jim Kent for his digesting tool "Protodig" and
Joanne (jdow) and Charlie (cheath) for providing a model for this digest.

   I've set up our digests so that you can get a summary by using the
bix SEARCH command.  If you join our digest topic and SEARCH for "====",
the thread summaries from the digest(s) will be displayed.  This should
be helpful for finding previously discussed topics.

   The syntax for the bix SEARCH command is:

      SEARCH [range] searchstring

TITLE:  How to Become a Registered Amiga Developer        March 2, 1987

   Applications for our new developer support program have already been
sent to all previously registered Amiga developers, everyone who receives
our AmigaMail newsletter, and anyone who applied for developer status 
within the last few months.
   
   If you are not in the above categories, but feel that you meet the 
qualifications and would like to apply for Certified or Commercial
developer status, you can request an application by calling 215-431-9180.


               >>>  CERTIFIED DEVELOPER PROGRAM  <<<

Our Certified Developer Program is for anyone developing salable products
for the Amiga.  Other parties who are also eligible are representatives 
from university departments, established user's groups or other computer
.More..
organizations, highly qualified professionals, and high-profile individuals
within the industry.

As a Certified Developer, the following services are available:

   1) Internal documentation
   2) Technical updates
   3) Earliest opportunity to get new hardware and software
   4) Amiga newsletter
   5) Discounted hardware
   6) Amiga conference invitations
   7) Access to open developer's conference on BIX
   8) Discount BIX application

The fee for this program is $50/year.


               >>>  COMMERCIAL DEVELOPER PROGRAM  <<<

The Commercial Developer Program is for those parties who have already
.More..
demonstrated the ability to develop and market a quality product.
Special consideration will be given to developers of products aimed
at new markets Commodore may target in the future.  Any established
software/hardware developers or publishers are included within these
criteria.

The Commercial Developer Program provides all of the services of the
Certified Developer Program as well as the following:

   1) Priority response to technical support questions via closed
      Email system on BIX.
   2) Direct phone support
   3) Eligibility for pre-release product testing and review
   4) Free or discounted conferences and seminars

The increased effort and resources required to provide this more intensive
form of support requires that we restrict the number of developers we
accept into this program.  The annual fee for the Commercial Developer
Program is $450.

Sure did...I also answer to "Hey you".
I don't really understand the system (geddaway) and I can't afford the
time taken by its blit routines, nor the interrupt vectoring - still,
this is the kind of machine that'll be around for a while so when the
time allows (hah) I'd like to wander round the libs.

Well, I had mentioned the same thing to RJ when he was in town
last weekend... [didn't think to call it an "A2001" though!]
Yep, why don't we join "Phoenix, Inc." :-) and start right away
on designing the next generation of machines... We'll have
a sand/water proof Amiga... battery operation... built-in Genlock
and TV receiver!
That's what *I'd* call a neat machine!

I've been tempted to see if I can speed up text some more by replacing
the blitter commands.  But I suspect the BltSomeStuff(rport,etc) commands
are pretty well tuned, maybe a 10-20% speedup is doable but not likely
much more working through layers etc.

Jeez, execute().  Wish I had a few weeks to work on it.  Then again,
if I found three weeks I don't think I'd be working on Execute(), unless
there's a special sand-proof model Amiga "A2001".

Maybe someday I'll try some "forbids" and some "own-blitters" and write

you're NOT a game it's very hard to get away with dumping the DOS.

Now Charlie, how about just dumping execute()?   Can I trade you for

THe point I was trying to make and should have stated outright is that people
are going to be running spreadsheets, word processors, GRAPHICS PROCESSORS
(such as dPaint and Images and Animator and . . .), MUSIC PROCESSORS 
(Soundscape, Deluxe Music Frustration^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^HConstruction Set,
etc etc), and GAMES all on the same machine. If they have to totally dump
memory to disk and read it back in every time they want to run a game then
they'll likely pass on that game. Hence a marekt for games that will not
trash your machine, will not trash your memory, and will more or less 
cocexist with your other software that may be crunching away however slowly
in the background. There will also be a market for games like StarGlider
in spite of the fact that they take over the machine. They will lose a
segment of the market, though, due to an unwillingness to needlessly trash
memory structures and programs left running in the background rather than
opening them every time they are needed. (How often do you tend to leave your
.More..
editor open while compiling? I do now that it is practical with that SB2 I 
have.)

'Course if I were writing a flight simulator, I'd probably dump the
OS too.  But there is a lot of lattitude for improving speed within the
system.  Also there's a lot of benifit to running cooperatively, in
my opinion and in a lot of other techie opinions.  Don't know if that
translates to sales to A500 owners or not.

TITLE: O/S (or not)
How's this for self-moderation...probably better here than Main.
Now look, what I'm saying is that if you need speed then you have to
consider dumping the system.
I don't think I like the tone of some of the dismissive "kiddie" phrases
 and the idea of limiting computing to spreadsheets and the like really
hurts. For those who turn to leisure and games, a specialised breed of
writers is growing. The consumers are demanding more from standard
hardware and for those embarking on programming a game, a choice must be
made right at the start whether or not to use the supplied o/s. Make the
wrong choice and you waste months.
I'm convinced that either way is valid - depending on the application, and
for sure, if the application is supposed to interchange with others, then
you'd better see to it that it conforms - otherwise its horses for courses.
Certainly on lesser machines - if you want to write a game, the o/s is
first out of the window - and it seems the Amiga is no exception.

It's nice code.  Fortunately I didn't have to modify any of the fancy
recursive tree stuff.  I did end up Amiga'izing it quite a bit since
I normaly use direct Amiga file IO, stdio, and mem allocation.
I've never used malloc, so the lack of corresponding free's had
me stumped for a bit.  Is freeing automatic with malloc ?  I replaced
it with AllocRemember()s and a FreeRemember in the cleanup.

Thanks - I just noticed the CR stripping last time I worked on it.

I've modified it to do everything I want in the final digest except
for editing the initial message lines and providing summaries of
the threads.  I added command line options for topic abbreviation,
chop to 76 chars, and first line only (skips initial blank lines).

So I edit the first line of each message, run dig on it, then clean
up the chopped lines and add thread summaries.  Since I edit before
I dig, I like to get the CR's out early.  I modified dig to discard 
trailing spaces, so I know can globally replace my CR's with spaces
and dig still recognizes "======== " as a separator.  This also
made it easy to discard initial blank lines since they now are
just a LF.

ONR:  Try entering a value for PERIOD when prompted by the SOUND program.
The period value determines the playback rate of the sound, a smaller
number results in a faster sound.  Try a number around 350 and adjust
it up or down to suit your listening pleasure.

Memory allocation problems have be fixed
Graph is much faster

Title: R#6728 OCTAVES??
----

Is it pssible to create muliple-octave instruments with PSOUND?  I have been
playing with it for a couple of days and can only get one-shot and one-octave
instruments.  Actually, the instruments deal is very cryptic.  You must select
the smaple with the highest octave?  What's up here?

(I have the FutureSound digitizer -- I boutght it before the PSOUND digitizer
was available.  After all, I am a TEXAN!)

Title: FOR DMCS USERS
----

Attention! Achtung! all Deluxe Music users. Uploaded and released to the
Section library this morning is "LSIN.ARC" a file which you MUST have if
you're a DMusic user.  This little puppy will examine any Deluxe Music
Score and report back which instruments it needs, and whether the
instrument is from the Deluxe Music Disk, the Instant Music Disk, or the
Rock 'n' Roll Disk. Since it is impossible to get all the instruments
Press <return> for more 
from all three disks on one disk by themselves, everyone owning all 3
disks sooner or later runs up against the problem of having a DMusic
score load and then DMCS reports back that it "can't find some of the
instruments," but doesn't tell you which ones! This program, LSIN will
let you find out ahead of time which instruments the score wants.

Many thanks to BCONRAD for the program and the upload!

Harv, Club Chair

Title: NEW VERSION AVAILABLE?

Two Questions:
     1)  Is Soundscape V1.4 officially available.  I saw a few notes where
         people out there picked it up at a show.  Has anyone that bought
         the program elsewhere had an update sent to them yet?

     2)  DIGIVIEW - What is the latest version of the DIGIVIEW software?
Press <return> for more 
         I just ordered one and received it with V1.0 software.  Has there
         been an update and how do I go about getting it?

         Thanks everyone for your help.....

                                             LGOLDEN

Title: R#6814 IFF INSTREMENTS AND SHAREWARE PROBS.
----

Wayne,

First, I just want to remind you (and every one) the PSound software
is shareware. I realise that alot of people have futursound or mimitics
digitizers and use our program. I often get calls from people wanting
tech support when there using our program with another digitizer. So
Press <return> for more 
far, we have reseive two $20 from people using PSound, and i think I
can say with a fair degree of confidence that more than two people
use PSound. This is nothing personal to you wayne, i just thought
I would mention this since it is a very common situation.

While I'm on my soap box.... This not just a PSound problem. We
at least can make some money selling our hardware (although not
much I might add.) This problem applys to most amiga software
that is shareware. I have seen athours of some very popular programs
complaining (MenuEd, and Blitz come to mind)  Also, look at BLINK,
I have no specifics on the money TSD has made from this, but if
it was a commersial program, they sould be rich. Every one who uses
lattice uses blink. If any one knows, i'd like to know how many
donations they have received. I know I haven't sent in mine (thou
I will try one day... this is the typical problem.) I did send in
my MenuEd donation, however. Anyway, enuf.

To the original problem, IFF insturments. (Manuals help answer these
Press <return> for more 
questions, BTW. ) To create an instrument in PSOUND:

1. Clear all slots.
2. digitize a sample (or cut one out of a sample you have)
3. Create other octives by using f=f*2, f=f/2. You could
record the other octaves, but this gets hairy... they have
to be mulitples of two in size and the repeat part in all octaves
is releated to the octave with the heighest freq.
. The reason
creating instruments is so complicated is directly releated to
the 8SVX IFF "instrument format" In a word, "its not very good" (Ok,
thats three words and one contraction.). But lets not get into
the merits of 8SVX now...
4. go to the octave with the highest frequecy and adjust the start
marker to where you want the repeat part to start. For no repeat
part set the marker to the far right.
5. Pick "Create Instrument" and use the defaults for any questions
you are asked.
Press <return> for more 

You sould now use the function keys to practice playing the instrument.
You will be warned if you have created an instrument that does not
conform to the IFF specs or if you have created an instrument that
is ok, but Instant Music won't like.

Warning: Creating an instrument is not easy. This is because the
IFF specs make it impossible to automate the proceess in a good
way. If you know what you are doing it is possible to create an
instrument, and if you don't know what you are doing, it is still
possible, but not quite as possible, if you know what i mean.

Good luck... if you have any questions call me during buisness hours
at (409) 846-1311 and ask for "Anthony" (thats me)

BTW, Studio Magic will be available "real soon now" and it has
much more powerfull instument creating powers than PSound. IT will not,
however, be ShareWare. There will be a demo version uploaded.

Title: R#6891 1.4 SOUNDSCAPE IS AVAILABLE

LGOLDEN,
  I talked to Dave at Mimetics Friday, and he said 1.4 is shipping.  They
will be shipping it to 1.3 registered users for free.  He said to give it
about 2 weeks.  Peggy Herrington has a copy I believe, so you might check
 with her also.

Welcome to Adventure Pro!

This disk contains a demonstration (called "DEMO") of what the Adventure Pro
system can do.  You can run DEMO from the workbench icon or from CLI.

Adventure Pro is a powerful graphic adventure development system for the
Amiga computers.  Adventure Pro is a true language that has many advanced
features but is easy to use. In fact, Adventure Pro is advanced enough to
create adventures that have all the power and speed of adventures written
in assembly language.



    Adventure-Pro supports:

        * Full color graphics (all modes except HAM)
        * User controlled colormap
        * IFF digitized sounds with adjustable volume
        * Animation sequences
        * Sounds slaved to animation sequences
        * IFF music (not shown on this demo)
        * Advanced language logic
        * Math capabilities
        * Full parser (eg., "Vaporize the mutant with the blaster")
        * Works with external memory
        * Works on A500, A1000, and A2000.

Adventure Pro comes with several different run time systems,
allowing you to choose only those features you want, thus saving
memory.  Adventure Pro is even a great text adventure system.

Adventure-Pro symbolizes its code, so your adventures run like lightning!

Of course, Adventure Pro is IFF compatible and works with all of the
music, sound, and graphics programs that are currently on the market.

Games that are created with the Adventure-Pro system are stand-alone,
and do not need a special disk or copy protection key to run.  This means
that your friends don't need to buy anything from us to play a copy of your
latest and greatest adventure.

The Adventure pro language includes:

    * Nested if/else conditionals
    * Variables
    * Math routines
    * Special situation conditionals
    * Graphic commands
    * Sound commands
    * Animation commands
    * Separated startup, normal, and background code areas
    * Disk IO, including a general GAMESAVE command
    * Formatted text
    * Auto word wrap
    * powerful parser
    * Nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions
    * Command line editor
    * Command line recall

Watch for several new adventures using this system coming soon from SunRize
Industries.

The SunRize Color Splitter allows you to electrically select the three primary color components necessary to do color imaging with a grey scale digitizer like Perfect Vision or Digi-View.


[bold]Theory of operation[p]

The Color Splitter decodes the signals that are necessary to create color, similarly to what is done in a color television. Synchronization pulses are then reinserted and then sent out as a new video signal. Color selection is done by moving the three-way switch through its three positions and digitizing the output from each position.

If you have access to a red filter, place it in front of your eyes. You will notice that everything has a red tint to it. Now if you look at a red object through it, notice how this object seems to stand out against the background, appearing brighter. The same thing will hold true for other color filters and objects that match the color of that filter. Research has found that only three colors (red, green, and blue) are essential to create all colors. If we look again through our filters, even though objects that are the same color as the filter appear brighter, other objects are also visible. The brightness of these other objects depend on the amount of primary color filtered. (Example: An object that is purple will have same brightness in both a blue and a red filter. An object that is white will appear bright with all color filters.) This process is called additive color mixing. (Example: green and blue make yellow). Paints that are mixed to produce certain shades use subtractive color mixing (Example: yellow and blue make green). In additive color mixing, white contains all colors. This is why white objects appeared bright in all colored filters.

Since the Color Splitter applies these principles, we can examine our black and white digitized images to determine which colors are predominant and increase or decrease the brightness of these specific colors accordingly. 


[bold]Setting up the Color Splitter[p]

The Color Splitter has two knobs on the front panel. One controls Saturation and one controls Hue. Each of these controls works exactly like their TV counterparts. However, since you cannot see the effects these knobs have until you process the color image, obtaining the best picture possible can be rather tricky.

The steps that follow will show you how obtain a good picture.


Step 1. Plug the wall transformer into the jack labeled '15 VDC'.

Step 2. Plug an NTSC color video source into 'Vin-C'. Use shielded video cables if at all possible.

Step 3. Connect 'VOUT' to the video in on your digitizer.

Step 4. Turn the saturation knob to about the center.

Step 5. Adjust the Hue knob to about the middle, too.

Step 6. Set the color select switch to the Green position.

Step 7. Digitize an image.

Step 8. Adjust Brightness and Contrast on your Perfect Vision.

Step 9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 until a satisfactory black and white image is obtained. (Note: Digiview owners will not have to do these steps).

Step 10. Digitize a color image as you normally would. Of course, instead of using your color filters, simply use the switch on your Color Splitter to select between the colors.

Step 11. If your software provides color control, use it only for touching up your final picture.

You should be able to get a reasonably good color picture using the middle settings for both Hue and Saturation.  However, further adjustment is necessary for the best picture possible.  If you decide to change your video source it will probably be necessary to re-adjust your Hue and Saturation settings slightly.

The Hue knob will generate proper colors at its mid-point.  Turning it either way will change these colors.  Saturation also works well at its mid-point.  Turning it counter-clockwise will decrease saturation (less colorful); turning it clockwise will increase saturation (more colorful).  Note: by fooling with the Hue and Contrast enough, you can get a picture that looks like a colorized Ted Turner movie.

Note:The method used to encode color onto a video signal is susceptible to noise. Over-saturating the image may result in grainy digitized images.

[bold]Hints for Perfect Vision Owners[p]

Perfect Vision and the Color Splitter were both made by SunRize Industries, so they work well together.  Remember, the connections are;

--video source to Color Splitter 'Vin-C'
--Color Splitter 'Vout' to Perfect Vision 'Video In'.
--Color Splitter 'L' to monitor 'Video In' (some times necessary)

When using some color cameras or VCRs, the connection between the 'L' jack and a monitor may be necessary to avoid unwanted 'jiggle' in your interlaced picutres.

Also, send in the coupon for your software upgrade as soon as possible.  This upgrade will let you digitize a color picture in "almost-real-time" (2 seconds) using the Color Splitter.


[bold]Hints for Digi-View Owners[p]

You still need a completely still video picture; the Color Splitter will not change the speed at which your Digi-View does its job.  Remember your connections;

--video source to Color Splitter 'Vin-C'
--Color Splitter 'Vout' to Digi-View 'Video In'.
--Color Splitter 'L' to monitor 'Video In' (some times necessary)

When using some color cameras or VCRs, the connection between the 'L' jack and a monitor may be necessary to avoid vertical lines in your digitized pictures.



[bold]Important[p]

If you are using a VCR with still-frame, be advised that many VCRs only output half of the video signal when in still-frame mode. Though this is not noticable by the human eye, Perfect Vision will stop working because of it (though the software will not crash). The only cure for this is to send the digitizer back to us, where for a $15 service fee we will install a switch on your digitizer allowing use of the half-signal.

Of course, if your digitizer works with the still-frame of your VCR, or you are using a laser disk or a color camera, you will not have the problem. If you are using a digitizer other than Perfect Vision, you may or may not be affected by this phenomena; we don't know. Rest assured, however, that the Color Splitter works just fine with all NTSC signals including the half-signal.

If you are working with a composite video source, be advised that the jack labeled 'L' should be terminated with a 75ohm resistance.  Usually this means just connecting the jack to a monitor.  If you are using an Amiga monitor, you will have a free 'Composite In' jack on the back.  You don't actually need to see the picture; just making the connection is enough.

[bold]NOTE[p]

Two jacks in the back of your Color Splitter are for the input of NTSC video. Most people use video sources that output what is called a 'composite' signal. This means that only the outer jack (the one labelled 'Vin-C') is used. However, some people will have a video source that comes out as two lines; one for the 'luminance' signal and one for the 'chroma' signal. For these people to use the Color Splitter, they have to cut a small wire on the circuit board.  This wire (called a 'jumper') is shown in diagram 1.  After you have cut this wire, your chroma signal should go into the 'Vin-C' jack, and your luminance signal should go into the 'L' jack.  If you do not want to cut the jumper yourself, SunRize Industries will do it for a $15 service charge.

The best way to learn to use the Color Splitter is to experiment. Because of the complexity of color video and the power of your Color Splitter, you will need to digitize many times before you get a picture that is the best possible. Remember that the most important thing in using the SunRize Color Splitter is to have fun.

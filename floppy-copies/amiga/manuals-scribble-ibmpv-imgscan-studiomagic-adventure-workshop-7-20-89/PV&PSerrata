ATTENTION:   On the Perfect Sound 1000 there are two knobs to control gain of the individual inputs.  The Perfect Sound 500/2000 only has one knob:  use it to control the gain of both inputs.

500/2000 owners should disregard the installation diagram in this manual, as it is for the Amiga 1000.  The Perfect Sound 500/2000 still mounts to the parallel (printer) port, though.  Please consult your Amiga's manual for the exact position of the parellel port.




ATTENTION:  If your Perfect Vision is having trouble keeping the picture stable as it is cycling,  please check:

1.  That your printer cable is correctly connected.  Also, some longer cables induce interference.  Buy or borrow a shorter cable and see if that makes a difference.

2.  On some cameras, a switch toggles between "Line Lock Sync" and "Internal Sync".  This switch should be set to "Internal Sync".  For instance, the Panasonic WV-1410 has the switch on the inside, mounted to the PC board.  This switch is factory set to "LL", and should be changed to "INT".  Consult your camera's manual to see whether it has this switch.

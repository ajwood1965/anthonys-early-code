1. The command k=k+1 didn't do anything. No error or nothing. However,
   k=k + 1 worked fine.  Spaces shouldn't matter and at least there should
   be an error msg.

2. "vb:throw" gives an error message, but its not relevant.

3. "end" just quits before you can read the last message.  It should ask
   for you to press return before clearing screen?

4. The symbolizer makes you press return at the end when you run from
   the CLI.  You shouldn't have to.

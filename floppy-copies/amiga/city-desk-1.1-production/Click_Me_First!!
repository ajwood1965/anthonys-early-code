[1mSymbol Fonts[0m
The Table in  Appendix F  shows the  complete set of Symbol font characters
which are available in most PostScript printers.

Symbol  fonts  are  accessed  differently  depending  which printer you are
using. If you are using a PostScript printer  you  may  access  the  Symbol
font,  by using  the  embedded command [[3msymbol[0m] or by selecting Symbol font
from the "[3mDefault[0m" or "[3mCurrent Text Attributes[0m" requester.

If you are using an HP LaserJet PLUS  printer  or  a  Preferences  printer,
Symbol  font is  accessed by  the embedded command [[3mcdsym[0m] or selecting the
Amiga  font  [3mcdsym.font[0m  from  the  "[3mDefault[0m" or  "[3mCurrent Text Attributes[0m"
requester.

On  HP  LaserJet  PLUS and Preferences printers the Symbol font is an Amiga
screen font printed as a graphic image. Because Symbol font is included  in
the  set  of  built  in  fonts for PostScript printers its quality on these
printers  will   be  appreciably  better  than  on  HP  LaserJet  PLUS  and
Preferences printers

To  use the characters in the Symbol font table you must first set the font
to  Symbol ([[3msymbol[0m]), or  cdsym  ([[3mcdsym[0m])  then  type  a  back-slash  (\)
followed by the value of the character of the you wish to print  (as  shown
in the table).

Example, to print capital Omega, type:

PostScript:
[[3msymbol[0m][3m\87[0m[[3mdefault[0m]

HP LaserJet PLUS and Preferences:
[[3mcdsym[0m][3m\87\[[3mdefault[0m]

(Remember  the  [[3mdefault[0m] command  after the character value returns you to
the current font and text attributes.)

You may also enter an ASCII  character  (any  character  on  the  keyboard)
directly after the [[3msymbol[0m] or [[3mcdsym[0m] command, but  this requires that you
know which ASCII character has the same value as the Symbol  character  you
wish to have printed.

Example,  type the following into a City Desk project, then print it to see
the results of using ASCII characters with symbol fonts:

[1mPostScript[0m
[[3msymbol[0m]Symbol fonts are great, but it's all Greek to me![[3mdefault[0m]

[1mHP LaserJet+ and compatibles[0m
[[3mcdsym[0m]Symbol fonts are great, but it's all Greek to me![[3mdefault[0m]

Included in the examples drawer on the Data Disk  disk  is  a  file  called
[1mCharacter_Value.cd[0m, which shows most printable ASCII characters followed by
their ASCII value. This file is also useful for displaying and printing all
the  possible characters available for any font, simply change  the [3mCurrent
Text Attributes[0m to the desired font and print it. Do this for all fonts you
may  be  interested  in  and  you  will  have a chart showing all printable
characters for City Desk and your printer.

[1mFile Conventions[0m

When saving files to disk, add identifiers to the end of file names.  These
identifiers,  or  extensions,  as  they  are  often  called  can help avoid
confusion as you look over the files on a disk.

For example the following files:  Open_House1.txt
                                  Open_House2.doc
                                  Open_House.pic
might all be used to create a project named Open_House.cd.

Here are a few of the extensions that we use here at MicroSearch:
.cd     City Desk Project Files
.obj    Text file exported using "[3mSave Object[0m" in the City Desk
        "[3mProject[0m" menu
.doc    Files created using a Word Processor (such as Scribble!)
.txt    Files created using a Text Editor (Such as TxEd)
.note   Files created using the Amiga NotePad
.Pic    Graphic images
.PicBW  Graphic image with one Bit Plane (Black and White)
.Post   PostScript File, created by using "[3mPrint to File[0m"
        ([3mPrint Options[0m requester)
.HP     HP LaserJet+ File, created by using  "[3mPrinted to File[0m"
        ([3mPrint Options[0m requester)


[1mPreferences[0m

Remember that Preferences set in City  Desk are not the same  as  those  set
from Workbench. City Desk uses the Preferences from Workbench for only a few
things.

[1mColor[0m

City Desk always looks at the colors set in  Workbench  Preferences,  these
are  the   colors  City Desk will use when creating it's own screen. If you
wish to change the  colors of your City Desk screen, you must first  change
the  color  of   your   Workbench   screen.  City  Desk  only looks at  the
colors set from Workbench  Preferences when City Desk is first  loaded,  or
when you  select  a different [3mScreen  Resolution[0m from  the [3mPreferences[0m menu
in  City  Desk.  If  you  find  a  combination  of  colors  that  you  find
particularly  appealing,  you should  save  these  Workbench Preferences to
the disk you normally boot from when using City Desk.

[1mPrinters[0m

City  Desk  also looks  at the  options  set in  Workbench  Preferences for
printer information. The information used by City Desk  regarding  printers
will vary depending on which printer you have selected from [3mPrint to[0m in the
"[3mPreferences[0m" menu in City Desk. The following list shows you which options
from Workbench Preferences affect City Desk:

Preferences:    City Desk  will send your Project to a  preferences printer
                in much  the same way that  Deluxe Paint II sends a graphic
                to your Printer.  Be sure and set for black and white only,
                or you  may get unpredictable results.


HP  LaserJet+   If,  in  your  Workbench   Preferences  you  have  selected
                "HP LaserJet PLUS" as the printer  you  wish to  print  to,
                City Desk will automatically select "[3mPrint to HP LaserJet+[0m"
                in the City Desk [3mPreferences[0m  menu. City Desk will also use
                either  the  Parallel  or  Serial port for you HP LaserJet+
                depending on which you have chosen in Workbench Preferences.
                Because  City  Desk has it's own special printer driver for
                use with HP LaserJet+ and compatible printers, you  do  not
                need  to  select  HP  LaserJet  PLUS  from  the   Workbench
                Preferences.  Selecting  "[3mPrint to HP LaserJet+[0m"  from  the
                City Desk [3mProject[0m menu will force  City Desk to use its own
                special printer driver.  You  will  still  need  to  select
                either  Parallel  or  Serial  in Workbench Preferences, for
                City Desk print your project. Finally, you may  force  City
                Desk  to  use  the  Workbench Preferences printer driver by
                first  selecting   HP  LaserJet  PLUS  from  the  Workbench
                Preferences and then selecting "[3mPrint  to Preferences[0m" from
                the City Desk  "[3mPreferences[0m"  menu.  This  will  of  course
                result in a reduction of quality when printing your project.

PostScript      City Desk disregards all Workbench Preferences settings for
                PostScript printers except color. City  Desk  always  sends
                information to a PostScript printer through the Serial post
                at 9600 baud using  it's  own  special  PostScript  printer
                driver.


[1mMousing Around[0m

Remember that the Right Mouse Button performs several functions within

City Desk.
Over the Title bar          It selects menu items (See pages A:1 & A:2).
Over the Toolbox            It selects requesters such as the "[3mDefault Page
                            Format[0m" and "[3mSize Options[0m" requesters
                            (see pages 6-25 & 6-26).
Over Overlapping Objects    It causes overlapping objects to alter the order
                            in which they are layered (see page 3-14).
When an Object is Hilited   It can abort an action, such as selecting text
                            to reflow.
                            [1mNote:[0m The Spacebar can also perform
                            this function (see page 6-26).


[1mSinging the Clipboard Blues[0m
(or why are my project files so darn big!)

City Desk 1.0 had a bug that was rather insidious.

When City Desk saves a Project, it also saves the contents of the Clipboard.
This is good because it allows you to leave items in the Clipboard that you
have not yet flowed.

When  City Desk loads a Project, it loads all of the  items that are in the
Clipboard.

When City Desk loads a Project, it does not erase the previous contents  of
the Clipboard.

When City Desk 1.0 loads a Project it loads but does not display, the items
in the Clipboard.

Imagine for a moment, that you have a project that is empty  except  for  a
graphic  image  in  the Clipboard that uses 32k of memory. Follow the steps
below saving and reloading the project to see what happens.

Save the Project.   The image in the clipboard is saved.
                    The Project file size is now 32k.
Reload the Project. The image that was in the Clipboard remains.
                    The image that was saved to disk is placed
                    over the image in the clipboard.
Save the Project.   Both images are saved.
                    The Project file size is now 64k.
Reload the Project  Both images in the saved file are laid over both images
                    in the Clipboard
Save the Project    All four images are saved
                    Project file size 128k
Reload the Project  The four images in the file are placed over the four
                    images in the clipboard
Save the Project    All eight images are saved
                    The Project file size is now 256k

Well by now you get the idea, after only 10 saves and loads the  file  size
is now well over 16 megabytes!

In  City  Desk  1.0,  you did not know that an object was in the Clipboard,
most of  the time. In City Desk 1.1, if an object  is in the  Clipboard  it
[1mWILL[0m be visible. If you wish to delete an object from the clipboard you may
of course  use  the [1mSkull[0m pointer but  this  can  get  rather  tedious. The
alternative to deleting objects individually from the Clipboard is to press
the [1mF4[0m key. doing this will cause a requester to appear which asks, "[3mDelete
all  objects in the clipboard?[0m". You may  now select "[3mOK[0m" which will remove
all  objects in the Clipboard or "[3mCancel[0m" which will leave  all objects  in
the  Clipboard  untouched.  You  may  press the [0mF4[0m key any time you wish to
remove all items from the Clipboard.

[1mSnapping out of it[0m

Remember,if you  have selected "[3mSnap to Top On[0m" in the "[3mFlow Options[0m" menu,
City  Desk  will  attempt to place any text to be flowed at the very top of
the column you select. If another object is already at the top of a  column
then City Desk will [1mNOT[0m let you flow that text into that column, unless you
first select "[3mSnap to Top Off[0m" from the [3mFlow Options[0m menu.

[1mGo with the Flow[0m

If you have selected "[3mAutoFlow On[0m" in the [3mFlow Options[0m menu, City Desk will
attempt  to flow the entire text chain into your project, starting with the
column you have selected. If any text  remains  to  be  flowed,  after  the
selected  column  has been filled, then City Desk will continue flowing the
text by placing it into the next  column.  City  Desk  will  continue  this
process  until  all of the text in the Text Chain has been flowed into your
project or until City Desk encounters an obstacle.

If City Desk encounters an  obstacle while flowing text, it will react in 1
of 3 ways:

1)  If there is enough room between the left column guide and the obstacle,
    City Desk will continue  flowing  the  text  chain.  It  does  this  by
    creating  a  new  text  block using the left column guide and the right
    edge of the obstacle as its left and right margins. After  passing  the
    obstacle,  City  Desk will resume flowing the text chain using the full
    width of the column

2)  If there is not enough room between  the  left  column  guide  and  the
    obstacle, City Desk will attempt to flow the text chain to the right of
    the obstacle by creating a new text block using the left  edge  of  the
    obstacle,  and  the  right column guide, as the left and right margins.
    After passing the obstacle City Desk will resume flowing the text chain
    using the full width of the column.

3)  If  there  is  not  enough  room either to the left or the right of the
    obstacle, City Desk will stop flowing  the  text  chain  and  the  text
    pointer  will  appear. This allows you to make decide where to continue
    flowing text. 

Remember, AutoFlow does not affect City Desk's capability to  automatically
flow  text  chains  around other objects on the page. City Desk will always
attempt to flow a text chain around an obstacle in the selected column. 

[1mAVS Wild Cards[0m

In the Search String  gadget of the [3mAVS Text Editor[0m and [3mHeadline Editor[0m you
may use two wild cards to make your searches more fruitful.

The Question mark "?" may be used search for any single character.
    Example "?at" will find Cat, cat, rat, Bat, mat, fat, etc....
            "b??m will find boom but not broom (b???m will find broom).
The Asterisk "*" will find any number of any characters.
    Example "s*t" will find sat, scratch, search for a hat, steal, etc...

[1mPreformating Your Text[0m

Remember  selecting  a  new  "[3mText  Format[0m" from the "[3mPreferences[0m" menu may
change  the  options  you  have  selected  from  "[3mParagraph   End[0m"  in  the
preferences menu. Always check the "[3mParagraph End[0m" before loading your text
if  you  have  altered  the  "[3mText  Format[0m". (For  best  results do not use
extended menu selection when setting "[3mText Format[0m" and "[3mParagraph End[0m".)

[1mSpecial Keys in City Desk[0m

Here is a list of City Desk special keys and their function.

City Desk
[1mF1[0m      Hilights all  objects  on the currently selected page by drawing an
        orange box around them. This can be useful for  finding  hidden  or
        overlapping objects (See pages 3-14 & A:7).
[1mF2[0m      Opens a  requester indicating the last page in your Project. Select
        "[3mOK[0m" to continue (new feature)
[1mF3[0m      Opens  a  requester indicating the amount of memory  available  for
        creating  Projects. Select  "[3mOK[0m" to  continue. This feature can  be
        very informative on Amiga's with less than 1 meg (new feature)
[1mF4[0m      Opens a requester asking "[3mDelete all objects on clipboard?[0m"  Select
        "[3mOK[0m" to  delete  all objects from the Clipboard. Select "[3mCancel[0m" to
        continue,  leaving   the   contents   of  the  Clipboard  unaltered
        (new feature)
[1mHelp[0m    Places the Toolbox behind, or in front, of all other windows on the
        City Desk screen

The [1mHelp[0m key can occasionally be confusing. This is because it  only  knows
where  it  last  told  the toolbox to go. If it last told the Toolbox to go
behind all other windows then, the next time it is pressed,  it  will  tell
the  Toolbox  to  place itself in front of all other windows. The next time
you press the [1mHelp[0m key, it tells the Toolbox to  return  behind  all  other
windows  again. This means that if the [1mHelp[0m key last told the toolbox to go
to the front, but you then used the Front gadget on a window to  place  the
window over the toolbox, you must press the [1mHelp[0m key twice. This is because
it thinks it is already at the front, it will go to  the  back  first,  and
then come to the front.

Graphic Editor

[1mF2[0m      Changes the current Pen color from black to white or from white to
        black. (see pages 5-6 &a:7)


[1mDefinitions[0m

The  following  words  and  phrases are use throughout the City Desk Manual

Text            Any character which has been, or  could  be  typed  on  the
                keyboard,  as  opposed  to  graphics  which must be created
                using a graphics editor or paint program

Text Chain      Any text which, when  flowed  into  a  City  Desk  project,
                occupies more then one object block

Object Block    The orange outline seen around  text which has been flowed,
                or graphics which have be placed. This outline will  appear
                when  selecting  various  pointers  and  when the [1mF1[0m key is
                pressed.  When an object block is altered, its contents are
                also altered. object  blocks  may  contain  ether  text  or
                graphics. Object blocks are sometimes  referred to as boxes

Text  Block     An  object block  which  contains text. A text block may be
                only one part of a text  chain. Altering the  [3mCurrent  Text
                Attributes[0m of a single text  block will  affect  the  whole
                text chain.

Graphic Block   An Object Block which contains a graphic

Flow  Text      The  act  of placing  text  or text chains onto a page in a
                City Desk project, by  selecting a column for it to  occupy

Soft Fonts      A generic term referring to fonts which can be  transferred
                from  a  computer to the memory of a printer, as opposed to
                "Hard" fonts which are stored on a cartridge which  is  and
                plugged  into the printer.  C-LTD  is  currently   offering
                [1mJet Set[0m, a collection of soft fonts, which may be used with
                any HP LaserJet+ or compatible printer.


[1mMore Fonts for PostScript[0m

We have increased the number of fonts, which are  available  when  using  a
PostScript  printer.  The following table shows which new fonts were added,
and their attributes. (see page B:16)

Roman   8   BI
        36  BI
        48  BI
Helv    8
        18  Bbi
        48  Bbi

These new fonts can be both a boon and a burden. If you are using an  Amiga
with  less  than 1 megabyte of RAM then, you should use the old fonts. This
is because the new fonts require City Desk to use more memory. If you  have
extended  memory  beyond  1  megabyte,  then  you  should use the new fonts
because they offer more flexibility.

The old fonts are on the City Desk Data Disk in the  Laserfontpool  drawer.
The  new  fonts are on the City Desk Program Disk in the Laserfonts drawer.

Font sets must be located in the Laserfonts drawer on the City Desk Program
Disk for you to use them. If you intend to use the old fonts, then you must
drag its icon from the laserfontpool drawer to the Laserfonts drawer.


[1mCD Print[0m

When you double click on the CD Print icon, CD Print will open a window  on
the  Workbench  screen. This window has exactly the same dimensions as, and
is placed precisely over, the menu bar of the workbench screen.  After  the
CD  Print  window  appears you may select options from the CD Print Project
menu. The CD Print window must  be  active  (selected)  for  the  CD  Print
Project menu to appear.


[1mSample Projects[0m

There  are  several Projects which contain examples of how to use City Desk
to create professional documents included, on the City Desk Data  Disk.  We
recommend that you select "[3mPrint to PostScript[0m" from the "[3mPreferences[0m" menu
before  loading these projects, as they were designed to be printed using a
PostScript printer. After loading the projects you may wish  to  save  text
chains  as  objects,  then load them into your favorite text editor or word
processor, to  more  closely examine how embedded commands such as [[3mhskip[0m],
[[3msettabchar[0m] and [[3mun[0m] can be used. You should also examine  how the overall
layout of the page is achieved, noting when text chains are  separated  and
where graphics are placed.

[nocj][cj][bd]Let's Create a Sample Page[p]




[nocj]This tutorial will walk you through the steps necessary to create a sample page. In fact, we will create this page--  the one you are reading now. The necessary files are included as text and graphic files on your City Desk master disk. City Desk is very powerful and takes up almost 200k on the program disk. For this reason, we have moved the clip art as well as several example projects and CD Print onto the Data Disk. This tutorial will allow you to use a basic Amiga System with at least 512K RAM for everything except printing to a Preferences printer (which must be done with CD Print, if you are using a 512k system). It is important to realize that graphics require a large amount of memory. If you plan to use a lot of graphics in your City Desk documents we suggest you acquire extra RAM for your system. We have included a simple graphic to use in this tutorial. Experiment with your own or some of the clip art provided to get an idea of the limitations of your available memory. We have provided a section of high-res clip art for users with memory expansion.

Before you begin, you should familiarize yourself with City Desk by reading Section 3, the Overview Section.

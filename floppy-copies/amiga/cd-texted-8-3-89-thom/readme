The files in the source directory should be recompiled and linked into
your system.  Some files, like "safeclose.c" are copies of yours.


Call like this:

texted(screen pointer, string pointer or null, starting location within
       string, x,y,h,w of text window, pointer to status integer);

texted returns a pointer to the return string, never your original string.

AdventurePro

AdventurePro is a powerful language for creating text and text-based graphic adventure games.  Good enough.


The entire game is defined by the programmer in four text files.  These files are called "prog.adv","roomdat.adv","graphicdat.adv", and "sequences.adv".  When the programmer has created these four files, he or she runs the symbolizer, which takes the files and packs them into one file (called "symbol.adv").

The file "prog.adv" contains the actual program code that executes during the game.  "roomdat.adv" contains the text room descriptions and data detailing the connections between rooms.  "graphicdat.adv" contains almost all of the graphic data (which picture for which room, which picture for which noun, etc.).  The  "sequences.adv" file contains information specific to graphic animation sequences

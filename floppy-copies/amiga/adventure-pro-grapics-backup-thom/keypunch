Dear Sirs;

     I have received and read your kind offer for my program. Exibit "A" is
said kind offer.  I apologize for it's condition; While reading it, I
laughed so hard that it just disintigrated in my hands.  Exibit "B" is my
reply to your kind offer.
     I sent the programs "Fathoms 4" and "Skeet!" to you in November of
1986; since then, this has been the first time you have acknowledged my
existence at all.  I did not receive anything at all (much less a decision)
for more than seven months.  I consider this clinching proof of the
existence of sentient snails.
     Did you really expect to ignore me for seven months and then see me
grovel in gratitude over the few pennies you threw in my direction?  You can
take your paltry "lump sum", attach it to a broom handle wrapped in barbed
wire, and shove it up your ass.  You can use it to buy condoms for your
pencil dick, before you fuck your infant sons up the ass. You use it to pay
for your turn at your sluttish wives and daughters. Go fuck yourselves,
because you will never fuck me!

                                    Your Avowed Enemy,





                                    Thom Robertson

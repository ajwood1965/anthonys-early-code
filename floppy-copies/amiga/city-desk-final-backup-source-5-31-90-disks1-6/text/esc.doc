[lj] - Left justify

[rj] - Right justify

[cj] - Center justify

[fj] - Fill justify

[lm n] - Set left margin (within the box) to n

[rm n] - Set right margin (within the box) to n

[indent n] - Set paragraph indent for left and fill justify.  The left
   margin is NOT used.  Example:

      This is lm 3 and
   indent 6 characters.

    (New paragraph) this is
        lm 8 and indent 4, an
        example of reverse indent.

[leading n] - Sets line leading to n.  Line leading is the distance between
   the baselines of the two lines.  Note that leading=0 is legal, and will
   result in the lines overprinting each other on the same line.

[spacing n] - Sets line spacing to n.  Line spacing is the distance from the
   bottom of one line to the top of the next.  Note that leading and spacing
   are mutually exclusive, i.e. you use only one method at a time.  Spacing
   is most useful when making extensive font or size changes, as the
   distance between lines will automatically adjust itself to the size of
   the fonts on the line.

[parspace n] - Sets the paragraph spacing to n.  This is the amount of
   vertical space between paragraphs.  Note that it is added to the leading
   or spacing.

[mag f] - Sets the text magnification factor to f.  Mag 1 is normal size.
   Both magnification (like mag 2.5) and shrinking (like mag .8) are
   allowed.

[magx f] - Sets text magnification in the horizontal direction only to f.

[magy f] - Sets text magnification in the vertical direction only to f.

[spacestretch n] - Sets the maximum space stretch to n.  When fill
   justifying a paragraph, spaces must normally be stretched so the right
   margin will line up.  If the amount of stretching exceeds this parameter,
   then the space between characters will also be stretched.

[it] or [italic] - Sets italics.

[bd] or [bold] - Sets bold.  Both bold and italics can be set at the same
   time.

[un] or [under] or [underlined] - Sets underline.

[compress] - Sets compressed mode.  Good only for laser fonts.

[pl] or [p] or [plain] - Clears italic, bold, underline, and compress modes.

[fsize n] - Sets font size to n.

[font s] - Change font to s (s is a font name, like "topaz" or "roman").

[font s n] - Change font to s and size to n.

[s n] - Change font to s and size to n.  Shorthand for font command.

your word processor edits text.  You also have access to special effects
previously available only in professional sound studios.

features, such as [bold]FFTs.[p] By taking a Fourier Transform of a digital
sample, Studio Magic can show you the frequencies that make up the sample.


[bold]Studio Magic[p] reads and writes IFF format, allowing you to exchange sound
files with Perfect Sound, Deluxe Video, Deluxe Music, or any program that
adheres to the IFF standard.  You can even create your own IFF instruments!

recording with the overdub feature.

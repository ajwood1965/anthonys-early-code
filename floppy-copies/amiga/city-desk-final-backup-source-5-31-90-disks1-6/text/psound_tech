[lm=0;cj;under]Some Common Questions:[p]



[roman 10;p;it;fj]

Can I use a microphone with Perfect Sound[p]?

Yes, but not directly.  The Perfect Sound inputs are
line level, thus you can not hook a mic up directly. To use a mic you
must go thru a pre-amp, such as your stereo. You can also get small
amplifiers for as little as $10 at Radio Shack.


[p;it]
What is the maximum frequency I can record?

[p;]The theoretical maximum frequecy a digitizer can record
is half its
sampling rate. Thus, Perfect Sound has the ability to record
frequencies up to 11.6 KHz. [p;bd;under]However, the point is moot.
[p] The Amiga has a low pass filter on its
outputs that eliminate all frequencies above 7KHz.


[p;it]Can I create Instuments for DMCS with Perfect Sound?

[p]Yes.


[p;it]How much memory does digitized sound use?

[p]About 10K per second of fair mono sound. Stereo uses twice as
much memory as mono, and higher sampling rates for better quality uses more
memory.


[p;it]Does Perfect Sound use external RAM?

[p]
Yes.


[p;it]If I have 512K of fast RAM as well as 512K of chip memory,
can I record 1 Meg samples?

[p]No. A digitial sample must be in
[under]contiguous[p] memory. The Amiga operating system logically
separates all RAM expansions as separate chunks of memory. Thus, if you
have a 512K RAM expansion (this includes internal upgrades) you will be able
to record two samples of about 400K each, but not one sample of 800K. The
same problem will occur if you plug two two meg boards into your Amiga. This
is not the same as one four meg expansion. The Amiga will separate the two
two megs into separate chunks.

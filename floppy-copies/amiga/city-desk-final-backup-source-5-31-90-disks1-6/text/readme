Beta version .3 is the second public release of "City Desk." The program
is still very much in development. The program will no doubt crash, and
many functions that will be included in the final version are not included
here. "City Desk" is being distributed in its early stages to give
you, the user, a chance to mold its development.  We very much want to
hear your comments. Please send features that you would like to see, Bugs,
and comments to SunRize Industries at the above address. You are welcome
to call; however, letters will have a more lasting effect.


A Short Manual:
---------------
This brief introduction was written by PROGRAMMERS, so don't expect much...

Some of the menu items are ghosted out.  This was deliberate, as some of the
features aren't implemented yet, and others we didn't want to include in the
demo.

This version was designed to run under version 1.2 of Workbench. It will
not run under version 1.1.  External "fast" ram is also supported.

Brief summary of Toolbox icons:
-------------------------------
Hand          Arrow
Resize        Crop
Magnify       Text
Page          Copy
lines         boxes


Note: When selecting a tool, you can use either the right or left mouse
button. Clicking with the left mouse button causes your pointer to change--
you are now using that tool.  Selecting a tool with the right mouse button
causes default options to appear. You can now change defaults, such as line
pattern and thickness on the line tool.



Hand - This allows you to move objects between pages and the clipboard.  The
clipboard is the background screen, behind the pages.  You should be able to
move objects from one page to another regardless of magnification.

Arrow - This allows you to move objects around on the current page.  You
can't move things from one page to another, use Hand instead.

Resize - Resizes text or graphics.  Click and hold the button down on the
object to be resized, pull the rubber band box, and let go.  For graphics,
the object gets bigger or smaller.  For text, the printable area changes,
allowing more or fewer characters on a line.  The size of the characters
does not change.  (change fonts for that). This tool has defaults (use
right mouse button to change them.)

Crop - Not implemented yet.

Magnify - Sets the magnification for the current page, from 1 (full page on
screen) to 6.  Most text is hard to read until about magnification 4 or 5.

Text - Brings up a little requester for you to enter some text in.  You then
get a TEXT pointer, and you point and click where you want the text to go.

Page - Allows you to select a page number to view.  More than one page can
be open at a time.  (Currently, you can only have two pages, this will of
course be changed).

Copy - Makes a copy of a graphic.  Use the hand or the pointer then to move
the copy.

lines - Allows you to draw horizontal or vertical rules on your page. The
default option line thicknes has not been implemented on this version.

boxes -- Not finished in this version


Loading Graphics
----------------
When you select Load Graphics, you get a disk file requester.  Select a
file, and you will get a "pick" pointer. Click where you want the newly
loaded graphic to appear. The graphics should be in IFF format and,
for best results, use only one bitplane (two colors.)
IFF brushes or full screens can be loaded and any resolution is supported.



Loading Text
------------
After you select a file, your pointer changes to TEXT.  Point to where you
want the text to go, and click.  The text will flow into the column you
select, starting at the pointer position and going down.  If all the text
won't fit in the column, the pointer will stay TEXT.  Click where you want
the continuation to go.  If you don't, and do something else instead, then
click in the first part of the text again with the pointer and you will get
another chance to place the rest of the text.

Formatting Commands
-------------------
Formatting commands, such as changing text, margins, etc. may be embedded in
the text.  All such embedded commands are enclosed in square brackets [].
Multiple commands may be entered in the same brackets if you separate them
by either commas or semicolons.  Commands are:

[lj] - Left justify

[rj] - Right justify

[cj] - Center justify

[fj] - Fill justify

[lm n] - Set left margin (within the box) to n

[rm n] - Set right margin (within the box) to n

[indent n] - Set paragraph indent for left and fill justify.  The left
   margin is NOT used.  Example:

      This is lm 3 and
   indent 6 characters.

    (New paragraph) this is
        lm 8 and indent 4, an
        example of reverse indent.

[leading n] - Sets line leading to n.  Line leading is the distance between
   the baselines of the two lines.  Note that leading=0 is legal, and will
   result in the lines overprinting each other on the same line.

[spacing n] - Sets line spacing to n.  Line spacing is the distance from the
   bottom of one line to the top of the next.  Note that leading and spacing
   are mutually exclusive, i.e. you use only one method at a time.  Spacing
   is most useful when making extensive font or size changes, as the
   distance between lines will automatically adjust itself to the size of
   the fonts on the line.

[parspace n] - Sets the paragraph spacing to n.  This is the amount of
   vertical space between paragraphs.  Note that it is added to the leading
   or spacing.

[mag f] - Sets the text magnification factor to f.  Mag 1 is normal size.
   Both magnification (like mag 2.5) and shrinking (like mag .8) are
   allowed.

[magx f] - Sets text magnification in the horizontal direction only to f.

[magy f] - Sets text magnification in the vertical direction only to f.

[spacestretch n] - Sets the maximum space stretch to n.  When fill
   justifying a paragraph, spaces must normally be stretched so the right
   margin will line up.  If the amount of stretching exceeds this parameter,
   then the space between characters will also be stretched.

[it] or [italic] - Sets italics.

[bd] or [bold] - Sets bold.  Both bold and italics can be set at the same
   time.

[un] or [under] or [underlined] - Sets underline.

[compress] - Sets compressed mode.  Good only for laser fonts.

[pl] or [p] or [plain] - Clears italic, bold, underline, and compress modes.

[fsize n] - Sets font size to n.

[font s] - Change font to s (s is a font name, like "topaz" or "roman").

[font s n] - Change font to s and size to n.

[s n] - Change font to s and size to n.  Shorthand for font command.


If one of these commands is not found, a font name is assumed.  So you can
use [topaz 8] or [diamond 20] or [emerald] as shorhands for
[font=topaz,fsize=8] or [font=diamond 20] or [font=emerald].

One other formatting command is available - the soft hyphen.  If you put a
tilde (~) in the middle of a word, the program can then break the line at
that point.  If the tilde does not appear near the end of the line, it will
be ignored.  If it is near the end of the line, and it would help the line
to have the word hyphenated, it will be replaced by a hyphen (a dash
character) and the word will be continued on the next line.

Numbers
-------
Numbers in the escape sequences can optionally have units following them.
If no units are given, inches are assumed, except for font sizes, where
points are assumed.  A number may have a decimal point.  Current valid
units are:

pt - point, = 1/72 of an inch
in or " - inches
ft or ' - feet
pc - picas, = 12 points = 1/6 inch
cm - centimeters
mm - millimeters
cb - cubits = 18 inches

If you think of any other useful units to have, let us know.

Examples:
10pt        10 points
2.54 cm     1 inch
.5          half an inch (anywhere but font sizes)
3"          3 inches


Altering Text State From Menus
------------------------------


If you do not wish to imbed escape commands in your text, you can set
the "default text state" (click right mouse button over ABC tool) to set
text attributes. You may also select item "Edit Text Attributes" under
"Edit" to change text attributes. When you get the "Pick" icon just select
the text block to change.


Cheap Editor
------------

This is an editor for quick changes to text blocks. The editor is made of a
string gadget and a proportional gadget. Carrige Returns are changed to "\n"
for the purposes of editing. You may enter a CR by entering "\n". In order
to enter a backslash, use "\\".

BUGS
----

Text flowing from one page to another is not working on this version.

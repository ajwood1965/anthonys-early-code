Dear Sirs:


Recently we have begun doing business with your firm on a regular basis.
However, we are running into some difficulty.
Currently our credit limit is set at $1000, but we are placing
orders valued at a minimum of $2000 per month.  We would appreciate it if
you could raise our credit limit to at least $2500.

If you need another credit reference, contact "Kan Yeung" at
MicroSearch in Houston, TX. Their phone number is (713) 988-2818.


                                          Sincerely,


                                          Anthony Wood
                                          President

Hi Tony,

1. Be sure and generate new .ps files with the laser utility.  I have
   changed what screen fonts it uses for each laser font.

2. I have changed the max sizes per font to 20.  Let me know if this
   should be larger.

3. Gray scale conversion should be working good.

4. Bobbys phone numbers are:
   (818) 796-4111 Home
   (818) 354-7492 Work (JPL)

   from 21 - 2nd, call dallas at:

   (214) 235-4391

5. Greeking is not implemented, but bobby will have it done by the time
   I get back.

6. Auto flow around irregular graphics is 90% done but not implemented in
   this version.  Talk to bobby about how it will work. Its not a macro,
   bit will just happen automaticly when you have it turned on. Theres
   a switch you set in the flow requester.

7. Everything else should be working OK.  There are a few features I still
   want to add. For examples, I didn't have time to put in layers.  If
   possible I would like to add when I get back.  It will take about
   3 days. However, I'm not sure how to work it with the manual.

8. For my mom & dads phone and FAX numbers, please call Liz at SunRize
   and ask her--she will give them to you.  Feel free to fax (best) or phone
   with questions.  Bobby should be able to answer alot of your questions.

9. These files are not organized correctly on the disk for distribution
   to beta sites.  Please get brian to set them up on 1.3 disk the
   way they will be for distribution to stores.  I didn't have time
   to do this.  Also, get brian to write a hard drive install script
   and use ICONX to make it WB compatible.  If brian can't do this
   bobby can.  We might want to include scripts that set the disk
   up automaticly for LaserJet, PostScript, or Prefernce use.

10. be sure and send beta versions to bobby deen (call liz for address)

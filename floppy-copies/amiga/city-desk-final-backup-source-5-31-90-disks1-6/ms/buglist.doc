[roman 12][leading 16t]
Latest beta test for version 1-31-89
\183 Autoprefs with PostScript, Scribble, Bookman 10 will crash the system. 
\183 When using sentspace command with long documents, random lines will exceed the right margin by approximately 1/8 inch. Has occurred mainly where there is a style change (boldface) in the middle of the line. (autohyphenation off). I am using 10 pt bookman and have tried with 6 & 8 points of sentspace. Same line in the document had a problem, and the distance past the right margin seemed to be related to the amount of sentspace- the 8 pt version went a character farther than the 6 pt version.
\183 Text editor or program adds a carriage return to the top of any text. If I import text that has no carriage return at the top, and immediately edit it, there is a carriage return on the first line. If I save the text from the text editor, the new carriage return is saved with the file. If I save and load the save document 3 times, I will have three new carriage returns. A Pain.
\183 Print document requester won't print a range of pages such as page 3 to page 5.
\183 In the text editor, when I save text from the page or cut, the requester doesn't retain the path and file name. If I flow the text, then re-edit and try to save the changes, I have to input the path and filename again. A pain. Also if the text was imported from disk, the "Save This Text" requester should know where it came from.
\183 Dotted boxes won't work (Object options)
\183 Text editor- loaded to cut. Pasted to text that was already in text editor. Selected delete and tried to delete a portion of text. deleted some, not all. Tried to delete again- Crash.
\183 When loading a large project, curser doesn't sleep, and the load takes forever. It is hard to tell if the program has crashed 
or not.
\183 After turning the grid off, the display doesn't refresh automatically.
\183 When you import a 4 gray scale picture (such as a workbench screen dump), the program will reverse it. Selecting invert graphic doesn't invert it. If you take the image into pixmate and 
reverse it, it import into CD, still reversed, but now the invert graphic selection will invert it.
\183 If I import a graphic of a different resolution than the City Desk screen, the aspect ratio is changed to match City Desk, As of yet, I haven't figured a way to resize then without distortion problems.
\183 WordPerfect files don't import correctly. spaces are stripped out between some words. I am mailing you samples that a beta tester sent me.




Stuff left undone from last bugs list.

\183 Objects don't transfer from one project to the clipboard and then into a newly opened project. You can see them on screen, but they are not saved with the new project or printed.
 \183 Can't use higher density settings with dot-matrix (anything over 180 X 180)
\183 Need Break and Connect text chains back.
\183 HP LaserJet+ with 2 or more graphics will print each as a separate page. Even the outline of a graphic will print on it's own page.
\183 If you try to close the print document requester before printing isshed. If you try to close the print document requester before printing is finished- Crash.
\183 Extreme memory problems when you open a page larger than #2 magnification.
\183 Sometimes creating or editing text in the text editor causes some portion of text to be repeated and added to the end of the text string.
\183 Change to interlace during a project- Crash.
\183 Need to Copy linked objects as a group or be able to link all objects on a page with one selection. (for quickly ganging up multiple copies of layout onto one page, such as 24 identical business cards on one page.)
\183 Decimal tabs? I need to know how they operate for the manual.
\183 If you change to 2 colors in the graphics editor, you can't read the requesters.
\183 Snap to top should snap to the highest available space on the page. If I have a graphic in the upper left of the page, snap to top should still allow me to lay the text on the page.

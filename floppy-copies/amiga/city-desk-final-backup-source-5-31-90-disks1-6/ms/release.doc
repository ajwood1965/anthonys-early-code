City Desk Version 2.01 Changes

05-01-89
========

1."Autofonts" was always always downloading to ser:
2. changed version number in title bar to 2.01
3. Problems with linked objects fixed:
   A. if you clicked on only one object when linking, there was
      a bug that could cause a crash in some cases.
   B. For some reason, that I may or may not have fixed, projects with
      linked objects would not load correctly.  They now load
      without causing a future crash, but the objects may unlink.

4. Graphic dpi wasn't coming from default object (does now)
5. CD Prefs postscript & virtual page buttons didn't work right
6. strip printing is now the default
7. Default object now saved with cd preferences
8. Laser Utility can handle path names up to 160 characters now
9. Hopefully fixed bug that would cause lu to crash after download error
10. Texted now prints help page when help key pressed
11. Texted was hanging on search/replease in some cases (avant ->avantgarde)
12. I checked file sizes when saveing a one bit plane image.  It is large,
    but not any larger than it used to be.  Its large because there is
    no compression, this can make the files 10 times bigger than an IFF
    file.  I may add compression in the future, but not real soon.
13. CMR 12 works just fine one my printer.  Make sure you don't have
    conflicting .hp files in laserfonts:  (such as f.hp & okidata.hp)
14. I have tried to get TOP with hp to work, but I can't.  It should
    be working the way I have it now, it just depends on how an hp
    treats the "draw pattern/grayscale" command.  It may be that you
    used a different printer for the manual page that worked. Try
    it with the printer you used before that worked and call me.
15. City Desk menus are now disabled when texted is called

=======

1. Fixed bug that would cause a crash when loading a gray graphic and there
   wasn't enough memory
2. When you have the "TEXT" pointer, you can press the 'b' key on the
   keyboard (for box) and then draw a box.  The text will then flow
   into the box you drew.  This command was actually added in the last
   version you received, I just forgot to document it.
3. Modified Laser Utility so that it will generate .hp files for large
   size soft fonts
4. Fixed bug in print to Virtual Page that caused a crash
5. Changed city desk so that it sent correct HP font change sequence to
   printer.  To do this, I had to eliminate the first 5 entrys in the
   .hp width tables.  This means that Any character below 5 won't work.
   This should be ok, because these characters are normaly control
   sequences.

7-7-89
======

1. Added 'X' command to the autofonts file.  (see sample autofonts) allows
   user to specify that font switching in HP mode be done with the font id.
   This fixes the "bug" of not all hp laserjet compatibles acting the same
   way to font switching commands.
2. Took out check for PAL systems.  Should automaticlly work with pal
   systems now.
3. fixed bug that occured when linking objects and you clicked on the first
   object twice in a row.
4. TextEd now converts text files just like the city desk main program
   when loading a new text file.
5. Changed the save/load project routines so they handle bigger files
   better.
6. changed default object dpi to 300 from 150.

8-1-89
======

1. Fixed spelling of "finished"
2. When clicking on explode twice, can now till use right mouse button
   to restore to previous window size and position
3. Texted remebers previouse size and cursor position when you edit the
   same file twice.
4. Fixed bug in texted that cused cursor to jump when going to new line
5. Fixed bug that caused cursor to jump when doing a cut
6. changed icons for copy, erase in texted
7. When you do "NEW" fist page is correctly set from autoprefs.  Before,
   first page would be in the default two collumn format.  Now, autoprefs
   is loaded and the default odd page format is used for page one.
8. Note that the default stack size is not sufficiant for City Desk.  I
   use a stack of 20,000 and this works ok.  To avoid strange crashes,
   you must set the stack from the CLI when running from cli and with
   the workbench info command when running from workbench.

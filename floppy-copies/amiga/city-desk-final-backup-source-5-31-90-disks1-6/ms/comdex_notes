City Desk 2.0 Notes for Atlanta Comdex '88
------------------------------------------

Methods for demoing a GURU or TASK HELD message:

1. Link objects together then move them off the page.

2. Create a graphic in the graphic editor the re-edit it.

3. In interlace, size the text editor window larger than half
   the screen.


Bugs:

1. The grid dots don't seem to be where the snap to grid points are.
2. Don't create graphics in the graphics editor.  It seems to be
   fairly flaky.  Editing graphics loaded of disk seems to work ok.

Suggestions:

You can demo graphics by loading some grayscale pictures and some one
bit plane line art (logo, etc.)  You can use the graphics editor to
edit the line art, but don't try and edit the grayscale picture.

After you load a picture, try using the text editor to write a caption
and place it under the picture. Then use link objects to link them
together. You can now have lots of fun moveing them together.

Other fun things to do are create a default page with a letter head
on it. Now open a few reqular pages.

Set your printer to EpsonX 120 X 72 for good looking screen text.

The file 'gen_ps_font' is used to create new font sizes or styles for
postscript printers.  When your run this program, your current directory
should be "afm".  Thus if you type "dir" you should see "disk1", "disk2",
and "disk3".

When you run this program you will be asked the following questions:

"Enter output filename? "

Enter a valid path & filename to put font data into. This should
probably end in .ps. Example "dh0:laserfonts/myfonts.ps"

If the file you entered already exits, you will be asked
"file 'xxx' already exists. (A)ppend or (O)verwrite?"
If you type 'a' the new font info will be added to the old. If you
type 'o' the old stuff will be destroyed

"Enter Global Font Size or Return"
If you press return, you will be asked for font sizes to generate for
each font. If you enter some sizes, the same sizes will be generated
for all fonts. Example "10,12,14"

"Generate fonts with no attributes"
"Generate bold versions of fonts"
"Generate italic versions of fonts"
"Generate bold-italic versins of fonts"

These questions let you specify which attributes you want to generate
fonts for. Answer "y" or "n" or "return".  Return is the same as answering
"y".  You can use this section to narrow your font generation. Thus, you
could generate 72 point fonts but only in bold by answering "n" to all
questions except the one about bold.

After this, your fonts will be generated. Don't forget you can
run the program multible times and append to an existing file.
Thus, you could generate sizes 10,12 in bold, italic, and bold-italic.
and then just certain fonts in bigger points.  Also note that if you
run the program and don't specify a globle point size, you will be
asked for each font. This gives you the option to not generate certain
fonts.

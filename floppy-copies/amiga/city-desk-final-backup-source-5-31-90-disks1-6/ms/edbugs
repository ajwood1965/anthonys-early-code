---------------- GRAPHED -------------------

- get rid of prints
- be consistant on all tools, for example line draw stays in line but
   box does't.  There's know way to know which mode your in because
   the pointer doesnt change
- lots of times I have to click twice on color or tool box for it to
   register. Do you follow idcmp chain... you get window active and
   mouse down
- can't see file requester in graphics editor in the "load brush"
- file requesters won't load a file from a different directory
- graphed seems to crash alot
- 320 X 200 sigle point brush highligh to higlighty
- Magnify-- can write on title bar with right mouse button
- sometimes large brushes will overight just by moving mouse
- Remember size you entered with and use on exit?

============== INSTALLED NEW VERSION =======================

- when painting with a brush in fast mode, the busy pointer sometimes
   comes and then doesn't go away
- when changing resolutions, the top 10 lines or so of the graphic you
   entered with are lost
- when changing resolutions, "load brush" seems to quit working
- when the load requester comes up, pick some nicer colors.
- 320 X 200. when sigle point brush selected, it still overwrites menu
   to the left (when higlighted)


---------------- TEXTED -------------------
- just hit return, cant delete with bakspace key
- deleted return in a funny way & confused text editor
- Menu color scheem screwed
- cant back up to prev line

=============== INSTALLED NEW VERSION ========================

- make menus same color as city desks

Jan 31, 1989

1. Erase page now closes page.  When it is re-opened, it will be just
   like a new page is being opened--the default page will copy on to it.

2. BUGs Fixed:
      1. loosing characters on auto flow
      2. saving graphic crash
      3. Page default setup not copied on autoflow
      4. changed "current font" to "change font"
      5. text options requester wasnt keeping correct size
      6. assign fonts: command cleanup a little
      7. alternate charters didnt work in text editor
      8. couldn't read all requesters in graphics editor
      9. can now use 3 digit "# copies"
      10. sentspace now works with ? and !

MAJOR THINGS STILL WORKING ON:
------------------------------

1. Auto flow around irregular shaped graphics
2. Out Of Memory Error when pref printing
3. Break/Connect text chains
4. Text editor adding random characters

FEB 13 1989
===========

1. Proof option in text requester now works
2. Irregular flow around graphics now works
3. Bug of random characters apearing in text editor now fixed.
4. All known Memory problems cleaned up
5. checked word perfect text load, but found no bugs
6. "automacros" file now checked for and loaded
7. auto hyphenation wasn't working. Now it is.
8. [print page] didn't copy new page number when copied from default page
10. Break text chain now works
11. Connect text chain now works
12. Bug that caused text to be placed a little lower than were you pointed
    to has been fixed.
13. Bug that caused underline to crash when tabed too far fixed
14. Greeking is attempting to function in an orderly fashion

THINGS TO DO STILL:
-------------------

1. Load/Save doesn't save irregular text. When I fix this, old
   project files wont load anymore!
2. Dashed boxes doesn't work
3. Print to virtual page doesnt work yet

Thats all I have left, except for fixing bugs I havent found yet.  Please
check and see if dot matrix printing/memmory problems are fixed.  I have
cleaned up alot of memory problems, but I didn't check pref printing.
This version is totaly finished except for the above three things. I
will have them fixed by wednsday.

FEB 21, 1989
============

1. Fixed bug that caused fonts not to load from autoprefs
2. Fixed bug that caused autoprefs to crash if there was text on def page
3. Text editor changes:
   a. Clicking scroll bar sometimes caused edits to come undone
   b. problems delteing returns fixed
   c. right arrow at end of line doesnt wrap anymore
   d. requesters remember path name
   e. Problem with delete fixed (I think, needs extensive testing)
4. Dashed boxes work with hp, and probably work with ps & pref printers
5. Any text chain created now looks at the irregular flow flag and
   remembers it.  Whenever that text chain is resized it uses the
   flow method it was created with.  Thus the old kind of flow and
   irregular flow are both supported.  To resize a text object on
   top of a screened box, make sure the text object was cretaed with
   irregular flow off, other wise wierd things will happen.
6. new commands added: irrmargin, irrminwidth, savefont, restorefont
7. two new reserved variables: irrmargin, irrminwidth


NOTES
-----

1. I can't cause append to crash. Please post projects to bbs that causes
   crash.
2. I have totaly redone the way lines and boxes are handled internally.
   I cant test postscript so please test. Dont forget to test dashed.
3. Bobby cant duplicate the margin problems with your file from the
   bbs.  Please try again and write post file with your exact configuration.
   (fonts, pref settings, flow options, etc.)
4. This version is REAL close to being finished, so please report all
    bugs.  Even bugs previously reported but not fixed.

THINGS LEFT TO DO:
------------------

1. Impliment virtual page printing (easy)
2. fix bug of preference printing droping characters
3. Make Postscript print to par: when preferences set to parallel printer
4. Bobby will add about three new commands
5. ETA of finished program: Monday, 8am.

Feb 27, 1989
============

1. We have totaly changed the defintion of an internal unit called a
   'coord'.  This was a rather drastic step, but needed to fix the problem
   of droping bits on preference printing.  The end result is that pref
   printing should work great now, but a lot of testing is needed to
   find all the little bugs that may have been introduced by this change.
2. 'edit page format' now excepts expresions and units besides inches.
   (eg., 1cm, 32pt, 1cm+1", .5)
3. fixed bug in laser_utility that casued it to crash in some cases when
   generateing .hp files from a soft font.
4. Create hp soft fonts cmr (computer modern roman) 12 bold, italic, plain,
   and cmr 24 bold

THINGS LEFT TO DO:
------------------

1. Impliment virtual page printing (easy)

March 15, 1989
==============

1. Virtual page printing now works.  If your city desk prefs is set to
   "virtual page" the following things happen when you print:
   A. CD looks to see if any virtual page is open. (such as one
      created with VPM)
   B. If a virtual page exists, City Desk prints to the page, but doesnt
      send anything to the printer.
   C. If no virtual page exits, CD will open one called "CD_VirtualPage"
      and print to it. Then it will ask the user if he wants to print
      the virtual page on his laser printer.  Then CD closes the
      Virtual page.

2. Fixed bug that caused font to be garbage and crash system when you
   did NEW with autoprefs in your directory... You did know that
   CD reloads autoprefs every time you do a NEW?
3. Fixed bug that caused autohyphenation tables not to be loaded if you
   loaded a pref file that caused the autohyphenation flag to change.

   an old project was re-opened.

11. Heres a neat macro for drawing a line:
     [def hline '[un] [hskip 2.5"] [noun]']
12. Press the help key for a final list of commands. Are they all in
    the manual?

March 22, 1989
==============

7. fixed bug in graphed that caused filerequester not to appear
8. fixed bug that cased returns to appear at start of file when loaded
9. fixed small minor bugs in preferences printer driver.  Test EpsonQ
   driver (without a printer) and seems to work ok.  Does the EpsonQ
   have 24 or 16 pins in the vertical direction?  The driver says it has
   16.

March 29, 1989
==============

1. Irregular flow now flows around text objects.  I also had no problems
   with lines.  But I'm not sure this is fixed.
2. You can now resize text on top of a block with irregular flow on
3. Bug that caused wierd things to happen when changing printer fixed

March 30, 1989
==============
1. HP margins now correct (outline page fixed)
2. Bug when changing to hp that caused "courier.font" not found, fixed.
3. Found bug that caused crashes with 24 pin printers.  Its caused by
   a bug in the DumpRPort command in 1.3.  It works now, but the left
   margin will be off a little (up to 16 pixels)
4. The black strips on printouts are not caused by city desk... try
   printing with dpaint, it puts them there too.
5. The problem with 24 pin printers skipping an inch at the bottom of
   each page was because you had "perferation skip" set on the printer.
   This needed to be off.
6. Tested with HP Laserjet at 300 dpi using perferences driver and it
   works fine.  Fonts look really good with the 300dpi amiga fonts from
   C-LTD.  Those fonts work good on 24 pin printers and deskjets too.
7. Fixed bug that caused large boxes not to work on high density printers
   (This was another operating system bug, not my fault you know)

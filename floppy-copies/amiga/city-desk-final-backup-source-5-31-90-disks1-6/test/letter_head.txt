Dear Kan,


I'm writing to express my concern over the future of Perfect Sound, MicroSearch, and SunRize Industries.  Our current arrangement is not satisfactory to myself. I feel that MicroSearch is not upholding the spirit or letter of our original agreement.  As you will recall our arrangement called for MicroSearch to provide financial and marketing support to SunRize Industries in return for exclusive distribution of Perfect Sound.  Financial support would come in the form of advance payment for Perfect Sound units.

The agreement for advance payment for Perfect Sound shipments was the primary reason I agreed to an exclusive distribution arrangement with MicroSearch; however, I have yet to see an advance payment. Currently it takes us forty five days to collect on an invoice, even though we have to pay our suppliers before we we even ship to MicroSearch.

I also feel that MicroSearch's marketing of Perfect Sound has been poor.  I haven't seen an ad for Perfect Sound in over a year.  Not a dealer flyer, a magazine ad, or even an ad in a distributor catalog.  When I called Tom Hayden to discuss the recent competition (Precision Software) he not only wasn't aware of its existence, his reply was "I'm not concerned."

The situation can not continue the way it is.  I'm very concerned about the competition and I can't afford to wait 45 days for payment.  Perfect Sound sales have remained almost constant for the last year whereas I would hope they would increase.  I understand that it's hard to justify putting much work into Perfect Sound when you only make $10 per unit. However, you should have thought of this when we made the agreement.  You can not keep collecting $4200 a month for doing nothing.  To remedy the current problems, I propose the following solution:

1. MicroSearch starts paying NET by April 1st.
2. MicroSearch starts meeting sales goals to be agreed upon.
3. SunRize is allowed to run certain promotions
[hskip .3"]A. Sales to end users generated by direct mail.
[hskip .3"]B. Sales to end users generated through coupons in our products
[hskip .3"]C. Bundling deals that open new markets

Hopefully the above steps will solve our current problems.  If you have any question, feel free to call me.


Best Regards,



Anthony Wood

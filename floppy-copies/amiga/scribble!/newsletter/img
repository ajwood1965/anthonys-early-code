Introducing IMGScan II

SI is proud to announce that we will shortly begin producing the IMGScan II scanner.  This low cost, high density scanner was first introduced on the Atari ST computer, where it quickly became a best-seller.  Now we are re-designing it for the Amiga.

The secret to the low cost and high quality of IMGScan II is its scan head.  This remote head attaches to the print head of almost any dot matrix printer, and scans any page with a high-definition infrared receptor.  The vertical and horizontal resolutions depend (to a degree) on the quality of your printer, but with even a normal 9-pin printer you can get resolutions of xxxx x xxxx or greater!

IMGScan II scans in 256 gray levels.  The hardware plugs into your parellel (printer) port, and provides a pass-thru so you can still use your printer or other device.

IMGScan II comes with a manual, software, and our standard warranty for one full year.

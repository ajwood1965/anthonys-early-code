This file contains information that was not included in your manual.

1. Hard Disk Installation Tip:
   When installing Audition 4, use your original disks to make sure
   all of the files are present.

2. Sound Master has been added to the Configuration menu.  Select
   this option if you own an Oxxi/Aegis Sound Master sampler.
   Sound Master owners can toggle the microphone with the 'Z' key.

3. HiFi
   In HiFi mode, Audition 4 uses the 68000 to play sound rather than
   DMA.  In this mode, sounds up to 56,000 samples/second can be
   played.

4. In non-HiFi mode, Audition can play sounds faster than the
   conventional 28K DMA limit.  This is accomplished by skipping
   every other sample.  To play samples faster than 28K with 
   full fidelity, use HiFi mode.

5. If you record a sample and it plays back at the wrong pitch,
   you have passed Audition's maximum sampling rate.  You can
   1) Turn  off "Play while sampling" in  Configuration, or
   2) switch to a lower sampling rate.

Perfect Sound 3 - 8 Bit Sampler
===============================
Perfect Sound 3 hardware has several enhancements that give it better
sound quality and make it easier to use than other sound samplers.  These
include:

* Digital gain
   This allows you to adjust the input gain with easy software controls.

* Hardware based sampling clock
   This allows Perfect Sound to time the intervals between samples exactly.
   This eliminates sample jitter present on all other software based
   samplers.

* Noise filters and voltage regulation
   These filter noise out of the Amiga's power supply to ensure clean
   recordings.

* Track and Hold
   Allows very accurate sampling of fast moving sound waves.

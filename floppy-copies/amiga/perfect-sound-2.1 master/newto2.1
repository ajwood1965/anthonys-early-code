You may have noticed we are always trying to improve Perfect Sound,
both the software and hardware.  Since the latest version of the
Perfect Sound hardware looks considerably nicer than the original
versions, we are offering the following upgrade:

1. If you have an original Perfect Sound in the plastic box,
you can get a new one by either sending in your original hardware
plus $20, or sending in your original hardware and purchasing
Studio Magic direct from us.

2. If you have a Perfect Sound in the aluminum box (the one with long
pots and silver in color -- not the ivory one) You may upgrade by either:
sending the original hardware plus $25, or sending the orignal hardware
and purchasing a copy of Studio Magic direct from SunRize.

This zip file contains the "MicroAdventure" Language for
creating adventures for the TRS-80.

Three complete adventures are also included:
germdsk/cmd  - Germany 1942
time/cmd     - Ruins at Time's Edge
asteroid/cmd - Space Hunt

The following Emulator disk images are in this zip file:
advsrc.dsk   - contains the source code for the MicroAdv compiler
               and runtime system.
advtext.dsk  - contains the MicroAdv source code and /cmd files
             - for three adventures

Although all of these files were created on a TRS-80 
(except this one and the madoc.rtf file), the .asm and 
.pcl files can be opened and viewed in Word.

The /ASM files were assembled using MS EdtAsm+.

Scott Adam's "Adventure Land" and "Pirate's Adventure" were
the first adventures I owned, and certainly helped inspire this
system.  However, the "MicroAdventure" system was created 
independently from and is unrelated to the Scott Adams system.  

This code eventually evolved into a system written in 'C' for
The Commodore Amiga that supported sound, graphics, animation,
and full sentence parsing.  This system, called the "Adventure 
Workshop" was developed by SunRize Industries with the help of
Thom Robertson around 1988, and was never released.  Perhaps 
someday I'll dig it up and release it on the Net.

The first version of this system was written around 1981, although
this code was written circa 1983,  by Anthony J. Wood.  Any 
contact info in the .dsk files is wrong.

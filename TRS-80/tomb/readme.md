# Intro to  "The Endless Tomb"

"The Endless Tomb" is a "text adventure" and was one of the first computer game I wrote on my TRS-80 microcomputer circa. 1981 (when I was 15). 

It was inspired by ["Adventure"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure) as well as 
[Scott Adam's text adventures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scott_Adams_Adventure_video_games).  Both of which I enjoyed.  

I remember uploading TOMB.BAS to a local BBS in Houston to be a free download -- a predecessor to "open source".  
 But then I asked the BBS operator to pull it down, because [I had submitted it to a magazine](../../scans/1981-7-20-creative-computing-tomb.jpg)
 for publication.    

   -  [TOMB.BAS source code in BASIC](./tomb.bas.txt)
   -  [play with my Windows BASIC interpreter](../../windows/basic-classics/classic-basic-games-v1.0.zip)

Here is a screen shot from the windows interpreter:

Intro to the “Endless Tomb”

“Endless Tomb” is a "text adventure" and was one of the first computer game I wrote -- on my TRS-80 microcomputer circa. 1982 (when I was 16).   It was inspired by “Adventure” as well as Scott Adam’s text adventures.  Both of which I enjoyed.  

I remember uploading TOMB.BAS to a local BBS in Houston to be a free download -- a predecessor to “open source”.   But then I asked the BBS operator to pull it down, because I had submitted it to a magazine (CLOAD I believe) for publication.  I don’t recall if they accepted it.  The next year, I sold a BASIC adventure called Space Hunt for the C64 to Ahoy! Magazine.

Using my TRS-80 while in high school I also wrote “Quest for Fire”, an adventure written in Z-80 assembly, and the pièce de résistance :-), a language for creating adventures – MicroAdv.  I used this to write an adventure called “Germany 1942” which was one of “AW Software”’s two products, of which one copy was sold.

You play these adventures by enter two-word commands while trying to find the treasure or solve the puzzle.  Unfortunately, you can die, which requires you to restart the game.   This is why saving the game in progress was popular.  Much of the game is trying to figure out which two-word commands to use.  You also need to EXAMINE and LOOK at things a lot, to find the hidden items.  I (INVENTORY) and N, S, E, W are also popular commands.

1978/79

I lived in Holland from the summer of 1978 to the summer of 1979 and attended 8th grade at the American School of the Hague.  This is when I taught myself to program using the school's PDP-11 (after school), along with trips to the Hague's "computer museum" to use the time-sharing terminal and [Commodore Pet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET#/media/File:Commodore_2001_Series-IMG_0448b.jpg).

Below was one of my first, perhaps the first, program I wrote. I remember it was when I really started to understood how programming logic worked.

I remember fondly writing my first game "Battle Star Galactica". It was based on the popular Star Trek type games of the day.

And others I wrote on the PDP-11:

   - [Master Mind](./mastermind-scan.jpg)
   - [Slot Machine](./slotmachine.jpg)
   - [Smurf Art](./make-melvin-draw-smurf-result.jpg) - Created while taking "Make Melvin Draw" class.

**Hand Coded Space Invaders for Commodore PET**

I don't think I ever got this fully working, but i do remember a single vader version mostly working.  I have it saved on cassette tape somewhere.  I wrote out my code and then when I got a chance took the tram into the computer museum to use the PET.

# PDP-11

In 8th grade (about 11 or 12 years of age, in 1978-ish ) while at the American School of the Hague I taught myself to program in the BASIC computer language.  I would go to the "computer museum" in downtown Hague via the tram, and use the time sharing terminals and the Commodore PETs.  But mostly, I would stay after school and use my schools single and old PDP-11. THe only class the school offered was "make Melvin draw" during which you would use punch cards to create an ASCI art.  This was pretty popular during the day, and I have some ASCII art in my windows class-basic games collection.  The primary program I wrote was "Battle Star Galactica" which was modeled after the 'popular' Star Trek game of the day (you can play this Star Trek game in my classic-games collection in this repo).  I have my Battle Star Galactica  on paper tape (printed from the teletype!), but have yet to recover and upload it here.

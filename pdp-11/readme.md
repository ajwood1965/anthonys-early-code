1978/79

While attending 8th grade at the American School of the Hague I taught myself to program after school using the school's PDP-11, along with trips to the Hague's "computer museum" to use the time-sharing terminal and [Commodore Pet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET#/media/File:Commodore_2001_Series-IMG_0448b.jpg).

I remember writing the below program because it was when programming clicked for me.  It was one of my first, perhaps the first.

I also remember fondly spending a bit of time writing my first game "Battle Star Galactica". It was based on the popular Star Trek type games of the day.

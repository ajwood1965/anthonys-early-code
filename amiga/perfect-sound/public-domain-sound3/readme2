This demo was downloaded from the Software Distillery.  The description
which accompanied it was:

   This is a shareware product which is to accompany an audio digitizer.
   The program at the user level is nothing short of wonderful!!  It 
   will load in any sampled sound file of 24K or so and play it forward
   backward, faster, or slower and also GRAPH the signal!  does not work
   with the soundscape digitizer but it will work with the output files.
   The guy is offering a really good deal if you register.  Larry Diener

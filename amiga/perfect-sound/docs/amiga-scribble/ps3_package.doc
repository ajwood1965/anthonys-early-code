Digital Recording Studio in a box.


Perfect Sound gives you all the software and hardware you need to turn your amiga into a mini digital sound studio.  Using the Perfect Sound stereo sampler, you can record any sound directly into your Amiga.  Once recorded, the sound can be saved on disk or edited.

If you've ever used an Amiga before, you'll quickly master Perfect Sounds powerful editor.  Just use your mouse to rearrange, mix, cut or paste sounds.  You can play sounds backwards, speed them up, or slow them down.  And once you've mastered the basic tools, you can quickly move up to some of Perfect Sounds more advanced features.  Use a digital filter to reduce noise.  Add echos or reverb. Create instruments for use in music programs.  Perfect Sound can produce standard IFF instruments, such as those used in Deluxe Music Construction Set.

But don't forget that Perfect Sound comes with one of the most advanced eight bit digitizers available for any computer.  Separate Left and Right line inputs allow you to record in stereo.  A mic input allows you to record straight from a microphone. Digital gain for the input volume levels.  You don't have to mess with external controls.  Perfect Sound automatically sets input gain via software.  Sampling rates up to 40,000 samples per second. And, of course we've spent a lot of time in the lab testing Perfect Sound to make sure you get a clean recording.

Now the same technology used in CD players is available for your Amiga. Get Perfect Sound and discover digital sound.

Hi Bobby,

The trek on this disk was one i recorded.  Compare it to the one
you got from the bulletin board. You can tell the difference.

The two pots on the back of the digitizer control the left and
right input amp gain.

What do you think of my box? The only think i don't like
is that it is glued together, makes it hard to fix when
they break.  I should have final versions ready to ship
by tues 7-15-86.  I'm going to houston to try and sell them
to stores. The price list i gave you is my prices right now.

Take a look at the C reference card i sent you.. It's unfinished,
but see if you can think of some changes.

If you can, send me a copy of that disk with the sound effects
on it.

Talk to you later,

Anthony

Type "voice" to execute the program

You may need to increase your stack to avoid a crash. My stack is set
to 20000.

This program demonstrates a popular voice recognition technique.  The
program is not fast enough to work in real time on a standard Amiga,
so this demo loads pre-recorded samples.  The routines are speaker
dependent, and must be trained.  I have included three words, each recorded
twice, for testing the program (dog, cat, fox).

First you must "train" the program by selecting item #1.  For example,
train the software with cat1, dog1, and fox1.  To try and recognize
a word, select method 1 or 2.  Method 2 works best. You will be shown
a "d" (difference) between the file you select and each trained word.  The
smallest "d(norm)" is the closest match.  The files cat2, dog2, and fox2
are included to try and recognize.

Each file was recorded seperatly and all are of different lengths.

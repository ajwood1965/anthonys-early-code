Brief Overview
==============

Normally Perfect Sound comes with more demo sounds and a title
screen.  These are not included in this demo, so the menu "Turn
On Demo Sounds" will have no affect.

To hear the sample sound:

1. Select Open from Project Menu
2. Select file "demo.snd"
3. Select OK
4. Click on highlighted "demo.snd" to play
5. Drag mouse over graph to select range for use by editing options.

The buttons on the main screen are (top to bottom, left side first):

1. Play Range - first load a sound (demo.snd included), mark a
   range by dragging your mouse on the graph, then click this 
   button.
2. Loop Range - Will cause the marked range to loop.  You can adjust 
   the marked range while the sound is looping.  Click near the
   end of the highlighted area to move just one end.  You can
   also click  in the zoomed graph for precise adjustment.
3. Stop - stops any playing sounds
4. Set new play speed for current sample
5. Search for loop points.  Change search direction by clicking
   in zoomed graphs.
6. Delete marked range
7. Paste - First mark a range. Next click this button. Then mark
   paste point, in current or another sample, then click paste
   again

   mixed together

10. Append two slots togther


The Low Pass filter can take a LONG time.

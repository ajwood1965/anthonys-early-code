NOTES:

Directorys have a "type" associated.  For example, you plug in a catrtige
with digital sounds.  The OS will optionally automatically group
directoryies of the same type together.  Thus, the user might have a sound
file.  He clicks on the sound "file cabinet" and views all folders that
contain digitized sounds.

When you plug in a cartridge, It doesn't necessary appear as an icon.

Local area network support is built into the opperating system. What does
this mean? I'm not sure yet.

Often used applications can be grouped for easy launch, as in the NeXT.

CLASSIC BASIC GAMES
Last Updated: 5/04/02  

This package includes my Win32 BASIC interpreter, and a collection of 
classic BASIC games.

Click on the icon “Trs-80 BASIC” to start.  This will also run 
“autorun.bas”, which is a brief BASIC demo with instructions.  You can
interrupt the startup program at any time by executing another basic 
program (File | Open or Drag&Drop) or by pressing escape.

Check out my web site at www.awsoftware.org for other classic software.

More classic BASIC games are available on www.trs-80.com (which is where
I got several of the games in this package).  Go to the Model I software archive.
For example, "Star Trek III", another classic games, is available here.

For Scans of the original "Best Of Creative Computing" (the source
of many classic games), go to http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc1/

This BASIC interpreter is Trs-80 Level II BASIC compatible.  Several sites 
have scanned the original level 2 manual.  You can find it at:

http://pilot.ucdavis.edu/davidk/documentation/trs-oper.htm

If that doesn’t work, do a google search for “Level II BASIC Reference 
Manual”

If you’d like to suggest changes to my BASIC interpreter, or suggest 
games that should be included in this package, please send me an email.

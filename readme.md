# Anthony J. Wood's Coding History
This repository contains most of the coding projects I wrote since I learned to program until recent times. Most of them you can run with Emulators. In recent times, I have created separate repos for my latest personal coding projects.

# PDP-11
In 8th grade (about 11 or 12 years of age, in 1978-ish ) while at the American School of the Hague I taught myself to program in the BASIC computer language.  I would go to the "computer museum" in downtown Hague via the tram, and use the time sharing terminals and the Commodore PETs.  But mostly, I would stay after school and use my schools single and old PDP-11. THe only class the school offered was "make Melvin draw" during which you would use punch cards to create an ASCI art.  This was pretty popular during the day, and I have some ASCII art in my windows class-basic games collection.  The primary program I wrote was "Battle Star Galactica" which was modeled after the 'popular' Star Trek game of the day (you can play this Star Trek game in my classic-games collection in this repo).  I have my Battle Star Galactica  on paper tape (printed from the teletype!), but have yet to recover and upload it here.

# TRS-80
When we returned to Houston from the Hague I worked out a deal with my dad to buy a 'microcomputer'.  I would pay half (cutting neighbors grass), and he would pay half.   He found two used ones at work for sale -- an Apple II and a TRS-80.  I am not sure why, but i picked the TRS-80.  During high school I went through phases where I programmed, and when I didn't.  Initially the TRS-80 did note have floppy disk drives - software was saved to cassette tape.  At some point, my dad got me floppy  disk drives and a printer!  Also at one point I 'blew up' my TRS-80 while attaching a sound board I designed (which obviously didn't work correctly.)  Later I did get it work and sold one extra to my best friend at the time John Brunner.  That broken TRS-80 was expensive to fix and set me back a while.  Druing this time i also started my first 'company' - AW Software.  Here are the main programs I wrote.

## The Endless Tomb

## Micro Adventure System

## Boot -n- Copy

## Quest for FIre

## Compac

## Germany 1942

# Commodore 64
While in high school I went to a TRS-80 microcomputer user group meeting where they demoed a Commodore 64.  It was amazing, with color graphics and games that looked as good as those in the arcades.   I soon purchased a C-64 as well as the 1541 disk drive (more grass cutting money, and perhaps some from Burger King).  I mostly wrote BASIC software, but at least one had a 6502 machine code subroutine.  I also managed to sell some of my software to computer magazines w(which back then would publish software in the magazine.)

## Lunar Lander

## Space Hunt

## Renumber

## Faster 64

## 1541 Zip

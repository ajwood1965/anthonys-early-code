# Anthony J. Wood's Coding History
This repository contains most of the coding projects I wrote since I learned to program until recent times. Most of them you can run with Emulators. In recent times, I have created separate repos for my latest personal coding projects.

# PDP-11
In 8th grade (about 11 or 12 years of age, in 1978-ish ) while at the American School of the Hague I taught myself to program in the BASIC computer language.  I would go to the "computer museum" in downtown Hague via the tram, and use the time sharing terminals and the Commodore PETs.  But mostly, I would stay after school and use my schools single and old PDP-11. THe only class the school offered was "make Melvin draw" during which you would use punch cards to create an ASCI art.  This was pretty popular during the day, and I have some ASCII art in my windows class-basic games collection.  The primary program I wrote was "Battle Star Galactica" which was modeled after the 'popular' Star Trek game of the day (you can play this Star Trek game in my classic-games collection in this repo).  I have my Battle Star Galactica  on paper tape (printed from the teletype!), but have yet to recover and upload it here.

# TRS-80
When we returned to Houston from the Hague I worked out a deal with my dad to buy a 'microcomputer'.  I would pay half (cutting neighbors grass), and he would pay half.   He found two used ones at work for sale -- an Apple II and a TRS-80.  I am not sure why, but i picked the TRS-80.  During high school I went through phases where I programmed, and when I didn't.  Initially the TRS-80 did note have floppy disk drives - software was saved to cassette tape.  At some point, my dad got me floppy  disk drives and a printer!  Also at one point I 'blew up' my TRS-80 while attaching a sound board I designed (which obviously didn't work correctly.)  Later I did get it work and sold one extra to my best friend at the time John Bruner.  That broken TRS-80 was expensive to fix and set me back a while.  Druing this time i also started my first 'company' - AW Software.  Here are the main programs I wrote.

# Commodore 64
While in high school I went to a TRS-80 microcomputer user group meeting where they demoed a Commodore 64.  It was amazing, with color graphics and games that looked as good as those in the arcades.   I soon purchased a C-64 as well as the 1541 disk drive (more grass cutting money, and perhaps some from Burger King).  I mostly wrote BASIC software, but at least one had a 6502 machine code subroutine.  I also managed to sell some of my software to computer magazines w(which back then would publish software in the magazine.)

## Lunar Lander

## Space Hunt

## Renumber

## Faster 64

## Banner
This program would print signs on a lineprinter.  The user would enter their message (like "Happy Birthday"), and the software looked up each letter's bit pattern in the character ROM and then rotated and expanded each character to print the sign (each letter was the hight of a page, and line printers used pages that were connected to each other so that the banner might be, say 11" x 80", for example).   I submitted the program to Ahoy! magazine, but it was rejected.

## 1541 Zip
The Commodore 1541 floppy disk drive was notoriously slow, primarily due to the slow serial interface connecting the external drive to the C64.  1541 zip performed a "fast copy" by downloading firmware into the disk drive, as well as having 6502 assembly language software that ran on the C-64.  1541 zip wasn't the first program to do this, but it was one of the first, and I was pretty proud of it.  It was very tricky to figure out how to re-program the 1541 - I had very sparse documentation.  And I had no tools (like an oscilloscope) to monitor the serial lines to aid in debugging.   As well as using a faster transmission protocol that I designed, I also timed the rotation of the drive so I could send more than one sector per rotation. 

I have a [rejection letter](./scans/1985-5-23-ahoy-1541zip.pdf) from Ahoy! (it seems to have been sent late, as I think I wrote this program  earlier).  I recall it was also rejected by "the Transactor" - a more technical C64 publication.  I ran into the Jim Butterflied - the editor of Transactor - a few years later at an Amiga conference, and asked him why they rejected it.  He said that my article that explained how it worked was too short.

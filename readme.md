# Anthony J. Wood's Code History
This repository contains much of the coding projects I wrote since I learned to program until recent times. Most of them you can run with Emulators or on Windows.  I have separate repos for more contemporary projects.

# PDP-11
While attending the American School of the Hague in 8th grade I taught myself to program using thier old PDP-11 and wrote my first game: "Battle Star Galactica" [Readme](./pdp-11/readme.md)

# TRS-80
When we returned to Houston from the Hague I worked out a deal with my dad to buy a 'microcomputer'.  I would pay half (cutting neighbors grass), and he would pay half.   He found two used ones at work for sale -- an Apple II and a TRS-80.  I am not sure why, but i picked the TRS-80.  During high school I went through phases where I programmed, and when I didn't.  Initially the TRS-80 did note have floppy disk drives - software was saved to cassette tape.  At some point, my dad got me floppy  disk drives and a printer!  Also at one point I 'blew up' my TRS-80 while attaching a sound board I designed (which obviously didn't work correctly.)  Later I did get it work and sold one extra to my best friend at the time John Bruner.  That broken TRS-80 was expensive to fix and set me back a while.  During this time i also started my first 'company' - AW Software.  Here are the main programs I wrote.

   - "Compac" ReadMe
   - "Germany 1942" ReadMe

# Commodore 64
While in high school I went to a TRS-80 microcomputer user group meeting where they demoed a Commodore 64.  It was amazing, with color graphics and games that looked as good as those in the arcades.   I soon purchased a C-64 as well as the 1541 disk drive (more grass cutting money, and perhaps some from Burger King).  I mostly wrote BASIC software, but at least one had a 6502 machine code subroutine.  I also managed to sell some of my software to computer magazines w(which back then would publish software in the magazine.)

# Anthony's Early Software Code
I recently spent some time recovering my old programs and archived them on github.  I created this small web site to highlight some of the pieces I am most proud of for my friends, family, and curious on lookers.

# Ahoy! Magazine Articles
In the mid 80's computer magazines were popular that published programs and games.   Readers would literally type them in.  After a couple years of [being rejected](./scans/1981-7-20-creative-computing-tomb.jpg) i was [able to sell](./scans/1984-6-15-ahoy-composite.jpg) five while in high school. Here are four of the articles scanned from Ahoy! Magazine.

   - [Space Hunt](./C64/space-hunt/space-hunt-ahoy-april-1985.pdf)

# Highlights
Here are a few of my earliest programs that I remember fondly.
   - [Perfect Sound](./amiga/perfect-sound/readme.md) - Perfect Sound was top selling 8-bit sound sampler for the Amiga computer that I developed while a Junior in college in 1986.  I designed the hardware, wrote the software, wrote the manual, and got people to sell it.
   - [Lunar Lander](./C64/lunar-lander/readme.md) - A Commodore 64 game I sold while a senior in high school.  The same one in the above article.  But here you will find screen shots and code.
   - TO DO - Germany 1942 - Text Adventure for TRS-80 - 12th grade
   - [Battle Star Galactica](./pdp-11/battlestar-galactica.jpg) - This is a BASIC game I wrote in 8th grade using our school's PDP-11 minicomputer. [All of my PDP-11 BASIC](./pdp-11/readme.md)

   - [My TRS-80 Emulator for Windows](./win/trs-80-emulator/AWSoftware.exe) comes preloaded with some of my TRS-80 Software.
   - [My BASIC for Windows](./win/basic-classics/Classic%20Basic%20Games%20v1_0.zip) comes preloaded with some of my software (including Battle Star Galactica) as well as other examples of text games of the time.
   - A third party [Amiga Emulator](./https://www.amigaforever.com/) can be used to run my Amiga software
